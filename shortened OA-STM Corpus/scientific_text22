Integral-valued polynomials over sets of algebraic integers of bounded degree  Abstract Let K be a number field of degree n with ring of integers OK. By means of a criterion of Gilmer for polynomially dense subsets of the ring of integers of a number field, we show that, if h∈K[X] maps every element of OK of degree n to an algebraic integer, then h(X) is integral-valued over OK, that is, h(OK)⊂OK. A similar property holds if we consider the set of all algebraic integers of degree n and a polynomial f∈Q[X]: if f(α) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer α of degree n, then f(β) is integral over Z for every algebraic integer β of degree smaller than n. This second result is established by proving that the integral closure of the ring of polynomials in Q[X] which are integer-valued over the set of matrices Mn(Z) is equal to the ring of integral-valued polynomials over the set of algebraic integers of degree equal to n.  Introduction Let K be a number field of degree n over Q with ring of integers OK. Given f∈K[X] and α∈OK, the evaluation of f(X) at α is an element of K. If f(α) is in OK we say that f(X) is integral-valued on α. If this condition holds for every α∈OK, we say that f(X) is integral-valued over OK. The set of such polynomials forms a ring, usually denoted by:Int(OK)≑{f∈K[X]|f(OK)⊂OK}. Obviously, Int(OK)⊃OK[X] and this is a strict containment (over Z, consider X(X-1)/2). A classical problem regarding integral-valued polynomials is to find proper subsets S of OK such that if f(X) is any polynomial in K[X] such that f(s) is in OK for all s in S then f(X) is integral-valued over OK. A subset S of OK with this property is usually called a polynomially dense subset of OK. For example, it is easy to see that cofinite subsets of OK have this property. For a general reference of polynomially dense subsets and the so-called polynomial closure see [1] (see also the references contained in there). Obviously, for a polynomially dense subset S we have Int(S,OK)≑{f∈K[X]|f(S)⊂OK}=Int(OK) (in general we only have one containment). Gilmer gave a criterion which characterizes polynomially dense subsets of a Dedekind domain with finite residue fields [6]. His result was later elaborated by McQuillan in this way ([9]; we state it for the ring of integers of a number field): a subset S of OK is polynomially dense in OK if and only if, for every non-zero prime ideal P of OK, S is dense in OK with respect to the P-adic topology. By means of this criterion, we show here the following theorem.
