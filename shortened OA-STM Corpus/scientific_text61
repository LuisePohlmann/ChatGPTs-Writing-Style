Regeneration of native broadleaved species on clearfelled conifer plantations in upland Britain  Highlights • We examine native tree regeneration on clearfelled conifer plantations. • Mean regeneration density exceeded 1000stems/ha and was dominated by birch. • Regeneration is increased by the absence of ground flora after clearfelling. • Proximity to a wind-dispersed seed source increased natural regeneration. • Brash piles reduced regeneration density. Abstract In upland areas of Great Britain, large tracts of non-native conifer plantations have been established on poor quality agricultural land. There is now considerable interest in the conversion of some of these plantations to a more natural woodland comprised of native tree species. We studied the tree regeneration and ground flora on 15 upland sites (altitudes ranging from 120m to 380m above sea level) that had been clearfelled of conifers. Regeneration of native tree species was successful where a clearcut site was adjacent to mature native trees, which acted as a seed source. Mean regeneration densities of native tree species on clearcut sites were typically greater than 1000stems/ha, exceeding minimum recommended planting densities for the establishment of new native woodland. Whilst 10 native woody tree species were recorded, the regeneration was dominated by birch species. Regeneration densities were significantly higher on clearcut sites than on adjacent areas of unplanted moorland, probably due to the lack of a dense ground flora following the clearfelling operations. Our results indicate that where local native seed sources exist, clearfelling upland conifer plantation sites to allow natural regeneration has the potential to be an effective method of establishing native woodland.  Introduction Timber plantations have been widely established across Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (Zerbe, 2002; Yamagawa et al., 2010) with plantation forests now making up 14% of total forest area in western European countries (Forest Europe, 2011) and about 70% of total forest area in Britain (Brockerhoff et al., 2008). These plantation forests usually consist of fast-growing, non-native conifer species located on marginal agricultural land in the uplands (Humphrey et al., 2006). They are typically intensively managed for timber production with substantial site preparation before planting (e.g., ploughing, drainage, and occasional use of fertiliser) and harvesting of timber occurring by clearfelling after a relatively short rotation. Whilst plantation forests can provide habitat for a range of species (Humphrey et al., 2000; Quine and Humphrey, 2010; Bremer and Farley, 2010; Coote et al., 2012), semi-natural woodlands typically contain greater biological diversity (Brockerhoff et al., 2008; Bremer and Farley, 2010). Furthermore, plantation forests can result in soil and stream acidification (Carling et al., 2001) as well as potential negative impacts on water resources. Recently, a greater interest in woodlands for their ecological and recreational value means that semi-natural and mixed forests consisting of native species are becoming increasingly valued (Felton et al., 2010). As many plantations are now reaching the end of their rotations, there is considerable potential for establishment of semi-natural woodland on former plantation forest sites (Spiecker et al., 2004; Dedrick et al., 2007). The restoration of plantation forests to semi-natural woodland can be carried out through a range of methods. The conifer crop can either be clearfelled or the trees can be removed more gradually through multiple thinning operations. There are also a range of methods for establishing native trees including planting, direct seeding or natural regeneration. Natural regeneration is the establishment of trees from seeds produced in situ (Harmer and Kerr, 1995) and is the preferred means of achieving native woodland expansion in Great Britain (Forestry Commission, 1994). Potential advantages of natural regeneration include the preservation of local genotypes and greater structural diversity of the resulting woodland (Peterken, 1996), high seedling density (Holgén and Hånell, 2000) as well as increased cost-effectiveness (Tarp et al., 2000; Jonásová et al., 2006). Natural regeneration has been studied in a range of environments including degraded lowland tropical pasture (Parrotta et al., 1997), tropical mountain forests (Holl et al., 2000), boreal forest (Peltzer et al., 2000; Holgén and Hånell, 2000; Hanssen, 2003; Man et al., 2008; Man et al., 2009), lowland European forests (Madsen and Larsen, 1997; Emborg, 1998; Olesen and Madsen, 2008; Modrý et al., 2004; Swagrzyk et al., 2001; Harmer and Morgan, 2009; Wagner et al., 2010; Smit et al., 2012) and European mountain forests (Jonásová et al., 2010; Bace et al., 2012). However, the regeneration of native species on clearfelled conifer plantations is still poorly understood (Zerbe, 2002) with Wallace (1998)'s study of birch regeneration in clearfelled spruce plantations the only previous study in upland Britain. Here we report the first extensive study of natural regeneration of native hardwood species on clearfelled upland conifer plantations in Britain.
