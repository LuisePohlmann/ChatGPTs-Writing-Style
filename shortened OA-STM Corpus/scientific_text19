Amos-type bounds for modified Bessel function ratios  Abstract We systematically investigate lower and upper bounds for the modified Bessel function ratio Rν=Iν+1/Iν by functions of the form Gα,β(t)=t/(α+t2+β2) in case Rν is positive for all t>0, or equivalently, where ν≥-1 or ν is a negative integer. For ν≥-1, we give an explicit description of the set of lower bounds and show that it has a greatest element. We also characterize the set of upper bounds and its minimal elements. If ν≥-1/2, the minimal elements are tangent to Rν in exactly one point 0≤t≤∞, and have Rν as their lower envelope. We also provide a new family of explicitly computable upper bounds. Finally, if ν is a negative integer, we explicitly describe the sets of lower and upper bounds, and give their greatest and least elements, respectively.  Introduction Let Iν be the modified Bessel function of order ν, and Rν the (modified) Bessel function ratio Rν(t)=Iν+1(t)/Iν(t). These ratios are of great importance in a variety of application areas, including statistics [e.g., 7] and numerical analysis [e.g., 1], either directly or through the fact that by the well-known recurrence relations for modified Bessel functions, log(Iν)′(t)=Iν′(t)Iν(t)=Iν+1(t)+(ν/t)Iν(t)Iν(t)=Rν(t)+νt from which by integration and taking limits, log(Iν)(t)=∫0tRν(s)ds+νlog(t/2)-log(Γ(ν+1)). For functions f and g defined on the positive reals, write f≤g iff f(t)≤g(t) for all t>0, with f<g defined analogously. If neither f≤g nor g≤f, we say that f and g are incomparable. Let G be a family of functions on the positive reals and f∈G. We say that f is the least element (minimum) of G iff f≤g for all g∈G, and that f is a minimal element of G iff there is no g∈G for which f>g, with the greatest element (maximum) and maximal elements of G defined analogously. Let Gα,β(t)=tα+t2+β2, where in what follows we always (without loss of generality) take β≥0. For ν≥0, Eqs. (9), (11) and (16) in Amos [1] show that max(Gν+1,ν+1,Gν+1/2,ν+3/2)≤Rν≤min(Gν,ν,Gν,ν+2,Gν+1/2,ν+1/2). Such "Amos-type" bounds were re-established and extended in several publications (see Section 3 for details). These bounds are very attractive because they allow both for explicit inversion and integration. Thus, Amos-type bounds yield bounds (and approximations) also for Rν-1 and the antiderivate of Rν (equivalently, Iν and its logarithm). Let Lν={(α,β):Gα,β≤Rν},Uν={(α,β):Gα,β≥Rν} be the set of all (α,β) for which Gα,β is a lower/upper Amos-type bound for Rν, and write GLν={Gα,β:(α,β)∈Lν},GUν={Gα,β:(α,β)∈Uν}, for the corresponding families of lower/upper Amos-type bounds for Rν. In this paper, we investigate the structure of GLν and GUν under the condition that Rν>0, or equivalently, ν≥-1 or ν a negative integer.
