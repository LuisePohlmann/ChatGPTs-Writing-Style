A note on weakly hyperbolic equations with analytic principal part  Abstract In this note we show how to include low order terms in the C∞ well-posedness results for weakly hyperbolic equations with analytic time-dependent coefficients. This is achieved by doing a different reduction to a system from the previously used one. We find the Levi conditions such that the C∞ well-posedness continues to hold.  Introduction In this note we study the Cauchy problem(1.1){M(t,Dt,Dx)u(t,x)=0,(t,x)∈(δ,T+δ)×Rn,Dtju(t0,x)=gj(x),j=0,…,m-1, where t0∈(δ,T+δ), the equationM(t,Dt,Dx)u≡Dtmu-∑1⩽j⩽m,|ν|⩽jaν,j(t)Dtm-jDxνu=0 is hyperbolic with t-dependent coefficients, analytic in the principal part, and continuous in the lower order terms. Equations of the form (1.1) have been extensively studied in the literature. If Eq. (1.1) is strictly hyperbolic and its coefficients are in the Hölder class, aν,j∈Cα, 0<α<1, it was shown by the authors in [5, Remark 8] that the Cauchy problem (1.1) is well-posed in Gevrey classes Gs(Rn) provided that 1⩽s<1+α1-α (if α=1, it is sufficient to assume the Lipschitz continuity of coefficients to get the well-posedness in Gs for all s⩾1). This extended to the general setting the results for certain second order equations by Colombini, de Giorgi and Spagnolo [1] who have also shown that the Gevrey index above is sharp. A result for differential systems was proved in [7]. We also refer to [5, Remark 16] for the Gevrey-Beurling ultradistributional well-posedness for 1⩽s⩽1+α1-α. Equations with higher regularity aν,j∈Ck and lower order terms have been considered by Kinoshita and Spagnolo in [11] and by the authors in [6] in the Gevrey classes, yielding also the well-posedness in C∞ in the case when the coefficients aν,j of the principal part, |ν|=j, are analytic. There are also previous works on second and higher order equations using the quasisymmetrisers, see e.g. [4]. In [6], the assumptions on (1.1) have been formulated in terms of the characteristic roots while the Levi conditions on lower order terms can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the operator M. In addition, the quasisymmetriser has been used in [6] while here we use the symmetriser. We refer to [5] and [6] for a review of the existing literature for this problem. Recently, Jannelli and Taglialatela [10] treated Eq. (1.1) with analytic coefficients, without lower order terms, proving the C∞ well-posedness under assumptions that can be expressed entirely in terms of the coefficients of the operator M. The purpose of this note is to show how to extend this to include lower order terms with Levi conditions still formulated in terms of the coefficients of M. This will be achieved in this paper by doing a different reduction of (1.1) to the first order system which will allow us to include the lower order terms in the energy. Indeed, in the case of the homogeneous operators, the reduction used in [10], analogous to the one used by Colombini and Kinoshita in [2], was done to a system which is homogeneous of order one in ξ. Such a reduction cannot be used in the present context because the lower order terms introduce singularities in the symbols at ξ=0. Instead, by employing a reduction to a pseudo-differential system, also used in [5], we are able to avoid such singularities. Thus, the analysis in this note is based on a reduction from [5] combined with a number of results from [10], with a subsequent treatment of lower order terms in the energy under Levi conditions introduced below. An interesting feature is that the C∞ well-posedness holds for analytic coefficients in the principal part and lower order terms which are only continuous. We also give a result for bounded (and possibly discontinuous) lower order terms. Our main point in this note is to demonstrate that by applying a different reduction to a system one can handle lower order terms in the energy estimates. For specific equations (e.g. second order equations) this result can be improved by other methods, but this lies outside our scope here. In [1], Colombini, de Giorgi and Spagnolo, and in [3], Colombini and Spagnolo gave examples of second order equations with time-dependent coefficients which are not distributionally well-posed. In this paper, we also prove the distributional well-posedness of (1.1) in our setting. In Section 2 we introduce the notations and recall the results of [10]. In Section 3 we give our results. In Section 4 we give the proofs, and in Section 5 we analyse the meaning of the assumptions on both the principal part and lower order terms, and compare the obtained results with those in [6].
