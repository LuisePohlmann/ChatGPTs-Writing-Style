Sylow p-groups of polynomial permutations on the integers mod pn  Abstract We enumerate and describe the Sylow p-groups of the groups of polynomial permutations of the integers mod pn for n⩾1 and of the pro-finite group which is the projective limit of these groups.  Introduction Fix a prime p and let n∈N. Every polynomial f∈Z[x] defines a function from Zpn= to itself. If this function happens to be bijective, it is called a polynomial permutation of Zpn. The polynomial permutations of Zpn form a group (Gn,∘) with respect to composition. The order of this group has been known since at least 1921 (Kempner [10]) to be|G2|=p!(p-1)pppand|Gn|=p!(p-1)pppp∑k=3nβ(k)for n⩾3, where β(k) is the least n such that pk divides n!, but the structure of (Gn,∘) is elusive. (See, however, Nöbauer [15] for some partial results.) Since the order of Gn is divisible by a high power of (p-1) for large p, even the number of Sylow p-groups is not obvious. We will show that there are (p-1)!(p-1)p-2 Sylow p-groups of Gn and describe these Sylow p-groups, see Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.2. Some notation: p is a fixed prime throughout. A function g:Zpn→Zpn arising from a polynomial in Zpn[x] or, equivalently, from a polynomial in Z[x], is called a polynomial function on Zpn. We denote by (Fn,∘) the monoid with respect to composition of polynomial functions on Zpn. By monoid, we mean semigroup with an identity element. Let (Gn,∘) be the group of units of (Fn,∘), which is the group of polynomial permutations of Zpn. Since every function induced by a polynomial preserves congruences modulo ideals, there is a natural epimorphism mapping polynomial functions on Zpn+1 onto polynomial functions on Zpn, and we write it as πn:Fn+1→Fn. If f is a polynomial in Z[x] (or in Zpm[x] for m⩾n) we denote the polynomial function on Zpn[x] induced by f by [f]pn. The order of Fn and that of Gn have been determined by Kempner [10] in a rather complicated manner. His results were cast into a simpler form by Nöbauer [14] and Keller and Olson [9] among others. Since then there have been many generalizations of the order formulas to more general finite rings [16,13,2,6,1,8,7]. Also, polynomial permutations in several variables (permutations of (Zpn)k defined by k-tuples of polynomials in k variables) have been looked into [5,4,19,17,18,11].
