High performance inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells by incorporation of dense, thin ZnO layers made using atmospheric atomic layer deposition  Abstract A thin ZnO (<200nm) film grown by Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD) in a matter of minutes was studied as a hole-blocking layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-buyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based inverted solar cells. These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend. Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature. The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark. Graphical abstract Highlights • ZnO was deposited in under 5min using Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD). • AALD is a fast, ambient method that is compatible with roll-to-roll processing. • The AALD ZnO was used as the hole blocking layer in organic solar cells. • The devices had performances comparable with the highest reported in literature. • The low-temperature deposited AALD ZnO can be used in plastic substrate solar cells.  Introduction Organic solar cells are a very promising, low cost and scalable alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells [1-3]. Some of the highest efficiency organic devices are thin-film polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction junction (BHJ) solar cells [4,5]. In BHJ devices, the p-type polymer and n-type fullerene are intimately mixed to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network, which improves charge separation by providing a large interfacial area, resulting in a significantly increased photocurrent [2,6]. BHJ devices in the so-called 'inverted' structure improve the ease of fabrication because a stable, high work function anode can be used as the top contact to collect holes from the polymer [3]. A transparent conducting cathode is used to collect electrons from the fullerene on the other side of the blend [7]. However, in a BHJ device, the p-type and n-type materials would both be in contact with the cathode and anode, which results in recombination at the electrodes [8]. At the anode, this has been overcome by inserting an electron-blocking layer, such as MoO3 [8,9], V2O5 [8,10], WOx [8] or the polymer PEDOT:PSS [8-10]. At the cathode, TiO2 [9] and ZnO [1-3,7-10] have been used as hole blocking layers due to their low hole conductivity and high electron mobility [11]. These oxides have been deposited using vacuum-based processes, such as conventional atomic layer deposition (ALD) [12,13], and also ambient processes, such as sol-gel [1,2] and electrodeposition [14]. While ambient methods are attractive for the commercialisation of low-cost photovoltaics [1,2], most are batch processes, which limits their throughput.
