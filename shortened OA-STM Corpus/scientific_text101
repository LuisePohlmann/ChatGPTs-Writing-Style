Phialemonium infection complicating chronic suppurative otitis media  Abstract Phialemonium infection in humans is rare. We report a 7-year-old healthy boy who presented with chronic otorrhea, which persisted despite adequate antibiotic therapy and four preservative tympanomastoidectomy operations. Following 3 years of intermittent topical antibiotic therapy, cultures eventually grew Phialemonium, which necessitated a more extensive operation, combined with systemic/topical anti-fungal agent to achieve clinical cure.  Introduction Phialemonium spp are a type of dematiaceous fungi that are emerging as opportunistic pathogens of humans. To date, less than 30 cases of human Phialemonium infections have been reported, mainly occurring in immunocompromised patients [1,2]. However, infection of immunocompetent patients have been reported in the literature as well in recent years [3].
