Impact of temperature on CO2 storage at the Ketzin site based on fluid flow simulations and seismic data  Highlights • Seismic modeling demonstrates significant effects of CO2 on 4D seismic data (Ketzin). • CO2 saturation is insensitive to the reservoir temperature in Ketzin. • CO2 density is considerably lower for the higher reservoir temperature in Ketzin. • Qualitative impact of reservoir temperature is low on 4D seismic data from Ketzin. • Quantitative impact of temperature is considerable on 4D seismic data from Ketzin. Abstract Temperature is one of the main parameters influencing the properties of CO2 during storage in saline aquifers since it along with pressure and co-constituents controls the phase behavior of the CO2/brine mixture. When the CO2 replaces brine as a free gas it is well known to affect the elastic properties of porous media considerably. In order to track the migration of geologically stored CO2 at the Ketzin site, 3D time-lapse seismic data were acquired by means of a baseline (pre-injection) survey in autumn 2005 and a first monitor survey in autumn 2009. During this period the temperature in the storage reservoir near the injection well was observed to have increased from 34°C to 38°C. This temperature increase led us to investigate the potential impact of temperature on the seismic response to the CO2 injection and on the CO2 mass estimations based on the Ketzin 4D seismic data. Two temperature scenarios in the reservoir (34°C and 38°C) were studied using multiphase fluid flow modeling. The simulations show that the impact of temperature on the seismic response is minor, but that the impact of the temperature on the CO2 mass estimations is significant and can, with the help of the multiphase fluid flow simulations, be explained mostly by the impact on the density of the CO2.  Introduction It is well known that temperature is a major parameter influencing CO2 storage and migration in saline aquifers along with pressure and co-constituents (e.g. Kumar et al., 2005; Bachu and Bennion, 2009). For example, the trapping of CO2 at irreducible saturation is a direct function of temperature, as well as in situ pressure. However, only few experimental data are reported in the temperature and pressure range of interest for geological CO2 storage (Kumar et al., 2005). At the Ketzin pilot site, Germany, CO2 is being injected at about 640m depth with temperature data being continuously acquired with a permanently installed system (Giese et al., 2009). These temperature measurements are performed over the entire length of the Ketzin boreholes using a distributed temperature sensing system (Henninges et al., 2011). Ketzin is the first European onshore pilot scale project for CO2 storage in a saline aquifer and was initiated in 2004 with the aim to evaluate and develop methods for CO2 storage monitoring (Würdemann et al., 2010; Martens et al., 2012). The site is situated on the southern flank of an anticlinal structure, which has its crest approximately 1.5km to the north of the site (Fig. 1). The anticline is the eastern part of the Roskow-Ketzin double anticline (Norden et al., 2010) and hosts the sandstones of the Triassic Stuttgart Formation that serve as the storage reservoir (Fig. 2). The Stuttgart Formation is lithologically heterogeneous, consisting not only of sandstones with good reservoir properties, but also alternating with muddy rocks of poor reservoir quality. The sandstones vary in thickness between 15 and 30m (Förster et al., 2006) and are present in the depth range of 620-650m beneath the injection site. The Stuttgart Formation is sealed by an approximately 200m thick cap rock section of playa-type mudstones of the Weser and Arnstadt Formations (Förster et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). Monitoring at the Ketzin site is performed by means of surface-based and borehole-based methods. The latter use the injection well (Ktzi201/2007) and additionally two observation wells (Ktzi200/2007 and Ktzi202/2007), which are located at distances of 50m and 112m from the injection well, respectively (Fig. 2). The wells were drilled in 2007 to depths of approximately 800m (Prevedel et al., 2008) after baseline characterization that included a 3D surface seismic survey (Juhlin et al., 2007). CO2 injection started in June 2008 and more than 60 kilotons of CO2 had been injected by November 2012. Nearly all of the CO2 injected to date at Ketzin has been food grade quality, except for about 1500 tons of CO2 (purity 99.7%) from the oxyfuel pilot plant Schwarze Pumpe (Vattenfall) that were injected within a trial period from May 4, 2011 to June 13, 2011 (Martens et al., 2012). Therefore, the phase behavior of the CO2 is not expected to change due to the effects of co-constituents, e.g. SO2. However, in cases where the level of co-constituents is high changes in the phase behavior of the CO2 can be expected (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011). Numerical modeling of multiphase flow is an essential tool to ensure the viability of long-term and safe CO2 storage in geological formations (Kumar et al., 2005; Bryant et al., 2008). Thus, a number of reservoir simulations have been performed to enhance the understanding of the CO2 migration at the Ketzin site (Kempka et al., 2010; Lengler et al., 2010; Bergmann et al., 2010). Successful integration of reservoir simulations and 4D seismic data analysis at the Sleipner CO2 storage site (e.g. Arts et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2010) motivated us to integrate both methods also at the Ketzin site. The 3D baseline seismic survey at the Ketzin site was acquired in autumn 2005 (Fig. 1) and revealed a sequence of clear reflections from approximately 150ms to 900ms two-way traveltime (TWT) in the stacked volume (Juhlin et al., 2007). In the autumn of 2009, a subset of this baseline survey was acquired around the injection well after approximately 22-25 kilotons of CO2 had been injected (Ivanova et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). This first 3D seismic repeat survey showed a pronounced time-lapse amplitude anomaly at the top of the storage reservoir (Ivandic et al., 2012; Ivanova et al., 2012). The extent of this anomaly was approximately 250m in the S-N direction and 350m in the W-E direction. This anomaly, as well as delayed arrival times of reflections below the reservoir ("velocity push-down effect": Arts et al., 2004; Chadwick et al., 2010), demonstrated that CO2 injected at the Ketzin site could be monitored by means of surface-based seismic methods. As a follow up, the time-lapse seismic images were used to make estimates on the imaged amount of CO2, important for assessing storage efficiency and monitoring potential leakage. The minimum degree of accuracy is a crucial issue in these investigations. Such minimum thresholds establish the smallest amount of CO2 that is possible to be monitored by means of surface-based methods (JafarGandomi and Curtis, 2011). At Ketzin, quantification of the mass of the injected CO2 was performed using the time-lapse seismic data, petrophysical investigations on core samples, and in situ CO2 saturations from pulsed neutron gamma (PNG) logging as input (Ivanova et al., 2012). The uncertainty range in the order of 5-7% encompasses the true injected mass CO2. In the Ivanova et al. (2012) study the impact of reservoir temperature on the mass estimation was not included. However, temperature is known to have a significant effect on CO2 density and can presumably have an effect on the mass estimation based on the time-lapse seismic data. Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of CO2 density on pressure and temperature in the reservoir at Ketzin. Prior to the start of the CO2 injection, pressure and temperature at the injection horizon were approximately 6.2MPa and 34°C, respectively. Both pressure and temperature increased due to the injection (Giese et al., 2009; Würdemann et al., 2010). In October 2009, pressure and temperature reached values of approximately 7.73MPa and 38°C, respectively, in the injection well Ktzi201/2007 at the injection depth. At the observation well Ktzi200/2007, the temperature increased only slightly. There was no significant change in the values of the reservoir temperature at the observation well Ktzi202/2007 (Fig. 2) (Möller et al., 2012). Based on these observations, it appears likely that the CO2 density was around 260kg/m3 at the injection point (38°C) in autumn 2009, whereas it was near 320kg/m3 in the more distant part of the plume, close to the ambient temperature (34°C) (Fig. 3). In order to investigate the impact of the reservoir temperature variation on the interpretation of the 4D seismic data at Ketzin, we deduce quantitative CO2 mass estimates for both temperature limits in this study. In the first step we apply seismic forward modeling and fluid substitution using the so far established petrophysical models for the Ketzin reservoir sandstone (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2012). Subsequently, CO2 mass estimations based on reservoir isothermal simulations for both temperature scenarios are compared to those obtained by in situ PNG logging (Ivanova et al., 2012).
