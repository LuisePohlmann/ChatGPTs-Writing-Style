### Abstract

This paper presents an experimental study of bore-driven swash hydrodynamics on impermeable rough slopes. The research investigates the interactions between bore-generated swash waves and rough, impermeable surfaces to understand how these factors influence wave dynamics, sediment transport, and coastal erosion processes. Using a combination of laboratory experiments and high-resolution measurements, the study examines how variations in slope roughness, wave characteristics, and bore intensity affect the behavior of swash waves. Key findings include the identification of critical roughness thresholds that alter swash wave run-up, the impact of bore strength on sediment mobilization, and the role of surface roughness in modulating swash hydrodynamics. These insights contribute to a better understanding of coastal processes and have implications for coastal engineering and management practices aimed at mitigating erosion and enhancing beach stability.

### Introduction

#### Background

Swash hydrodynamics, the movement of water up and down the beach face driven by breaking waves, play a crucial role in coastal processes such as sediment transport, beach morphology changes, and coastal erosion. Understanding the interaction between swash waves and the beach surface is vital for predicting coastal behavior and designing effective erosion control measures. The dynamics of swash waves are influenced by various factors, including wave characteristics, beach slope, and surface roughness.

Bore-driven swash waves, generated by the impact of a breaking bore on the shore, are of particular interest due to their potential to induce significant hydrodynamic forces and sediment transport. When these swash waves interact with rough, impermeable slopes, complex flow patterns emerge that can influence beach stability and erosion processes. Despite the importance of these interactions, detailed experimental studies investigating the effects of slope roughness on bore-driven swash hydrodynamics remain limited.

These studies provide a context for understanding the impact of rough surfaces on swash hydrodynamics.

#### Importance of the Study

Understanding the effects of bore-driven swash waves on rough, impermeable slopes is crucial for improving coastal management practices and designing erosion control measures. This study provides valuable insights into how surface roughness influences wave dynamics and sediment transport, contributing to a better understanding of coastal processes. The findings have implications for predicting beach stability, designing effective coastal defenses, and managing erosion in areas with rough beach surfaces.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example of bore-driven swash hydrodynamics is observed in coastal areas with steep, rough slopes where high-energy waves impact the shore. In such regions, variations in surface roughness can significantly influence wave run-up and sediment mobilization. Understanding these interactions helps in designing effective coastal defenses and predicting erosion patterns.

Another application is in beach nourishment projects, where the impact of roughness on swash dynamics must be considered to ensure the stability of added sediment. By studying the effects of rough surfaces, engineers can better predict the behavior of nourished beaches and enhance their resilience to wave forces.
