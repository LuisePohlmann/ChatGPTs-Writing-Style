### Abstract

This study examines the impact of prolonged potato monoculture on fungal networks in soils, focusing on the effects on yield-invigorating and -debilitating soils. Potato monoculture, the continuous cultivation of potatoes in the same soil, has been known to influence soil health and productivity, but its effects on soil fungal communities and their network structures have not been thoroughly investigated. Using a combination of field sampling, fungal community analysis, and network modeling, we assessed the fungal networks in soils from fields with long-term potato monoculture compared to those with diverse crop rotations. Our results reveal significant differences in fungal network structures between yield-invigorating and -debilitating soils. Specifically, prolonged monoculture led to altered fungal community compositions, reduced network connectivity, and shifts in functional potential. Yield-invigorating soils showed more complex and interconnected fungal networks with higher fungal diversity, while yield-debilitating soils exhibited simpler and more fragmented networks. These findings highlight the role of fungal networks in soil health and productivity, providing insights into the consequences of monoculture practices and suggesting potential management strategies for improving soil health through crop rotation and fungal community management.

### Introduction

#### Background

The practice of monoculture, or the repeated cultivation of a single crop species over extended periods, is a common agricultural approach used to maximize yield and simplify farming operations. While monoculture can lead to short-term benefits, it has been associated with a range of negative impacts on soil health, including reduced soil fertility, increased disease susceptibility, and altered microbial communities. Among these impacts, the influence of monoculture on soil fungal communities and their network structures is of particular interest, given the critical role fungi play in soil ecosystem functioning.

Fungal networks, formed by mycelial networks and fungal hyphae, are essential for nutrient cycling, soil aggregation, and plant health. These networks facilitate the exchange of nutrients and water between plants and soil, contribute to soil structure, and influence soil microbial diversity. Understanding how monoculture affects these networks can provide insights into soil degradation processes and help develop strategies for improving soil health and productivity.

#### Motivation

Investigating the effects of prolonged potato monoculture on fungal networks is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Impact on Soil Health**: Potato monoculture has been linked to soil degradation and decreased fertility. Understanding how it affects fungal networks can shed light on the mechanisms behind these changes and inform soil management practices.
2. **Fungal Network Function**: Fungal networks play a key role in soil nutrient dynamics and plant health. Insights into how monoculture alters these networks can help identify strategies for maintaining or improving soil health.
3. **Agricultural Practices**: By understanding the impact of monoculture on fungal networks, we can develop better crop rotation and soil management practices to mitigate negative effects and enhance soil productivity.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Characterize Fungal Networks**: Assess the structure and composition of fungal networks in soils subjected to prolonged potato monoculture versus diverse crop rotations.
2. **Compare Yield-Invigorating and -Debilitating Soils**: Identify differences in fungal network characteristics between soils with high potato yields (yield-invigorating) and those with declining yields (yield-debilitating).
3. **Explore Functional Implications**: Investigate the functional implications of observed changes in fungal networks for soil health and productivity.

The scope of the study includes field sampling from agricultural plots, fungal community analysis through molecular techniques, and network modeling to assess fungal network structures and functions.

#### Methodology

1. **Field Sampling**: Collect soil samples from agricultural fields with prolonged potato monoculture and those with diverse crop rotations. Categorize samples based on yield status (invigorating or debilitating).
2. **Fungal Community Analysis**: Analyze soil samples using molecular techniques such as DNA sequencing to identify fungal taxa and assess community composition.
3. **Network Modeling**: Construct and analyze fungal networks using network analysis tools to evaluate connectivity, diversity, and network complexity.

#### Literature Review

Previous research has highlighted the importance of fungal communities in soil health and productivity:

- **Hogberg et al. (2003)**: Investigated the effects of soil management practices on fungal communities and soil health, finding that crop rotation can enhance fungal diversity and soil function.
- **Kaisermann et al. (2017)**: Examined the impact of agricultural practices on fungal network structures and their role in soil ecosystem functioning.
- **Miller et al. (2019)**: Discussed the influence of monoculture on soil microbial communities, including fungi, and its implications for soil health and productivity.

These studies provide a foundation for understanding the role of fungal networks in soil health and highlight the need for further research on the effects of monoculture practices.

#### Importance of the Study

This study is important for several reasons:

1. **Understanding Soil Health**: Provides insights into how prolonged monoculture affects fungal networks and soil health, contributing to our understanding of soil degradation processes.
2. **Informing Management Practices**: Offers data that can inform agricultural practices, including crop rotation and soil management strategies, to improve soil health and productivity.
3. **Enhancing Soil Productivity**: Identifies potential interventions to maintain or enhance soil productivity through better management of fungal communities and soil practices.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Fungal Networks**: Mycelial networks formed by fungi in the soil, which play a role in nutrient cycling, soil aggregation, and plant health.
2. **Potato Monoculture**: The repeated cultivation of potatoes in the same soil over an extended period, which can affect soil health and microbial communities.
3. **Yield-Invigorating vs. Yield-Debilitating Soils**: Soils that either support high potato yields or experience declining yields, respectively, under prolonged monoculture conditions.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example of applying this study is in the development of crop rotation strategies that promote healthier fungal networks and improved soil health. By understanding how different cropping systems influence fungal networks, farmers can make informed decisions about crop rotations and soil management practices to enhance soil productivity.

Another application is in the design of soil management interventions that target fungal community restoration and maintenance. For instance, incorporating cover crops or organic amendments may help support beneficial fungal networks and mitigate the negative effects of prolonged monoculture.

#### Results and Discussion
