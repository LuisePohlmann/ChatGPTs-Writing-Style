### Abstract

This paper delves into the study of Generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (GMR) systems, an extension of the well-known Macdonald and Ruijsenaars integrable systems, which play a crucial role in mathematical physics and representation theory. The Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems, known for their deep connections with special functions and orthogonal polynomials, are generalized in this work to include a broader class of interactions and symmetries. We provide a detailed analysis of the structure and properties of these generalized systems, exploring their Hamiltonian formulation, integrability, and spectral characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate the algebraic and geometric underpinnings that support these systems, presenting new results that extend classical integrable systems theory. Through explicit examples and computational models, we demonstrate the applicability of GMR systems in various domains, including quantum mechanics and algebraic geometry.

### Introduction

#### Background

Integrable systems occupy a central position in mathematical physics, providing a rich interplay between algebra, geometry, and analysis. Among these, the Macdonald and Ruijsenaars systems are particularly notable for their connections with special functions, orthogonal polynomials, and representation theory. The Macdonald polynomials, for instance, are a family of orthogonal polynomials that generalize several classical polynomials and have applications in symmetric functions and algebraic combinatorics. The Ruijsenaars systems, on the other hand, extend the Calogero-Moser systems to relativistic settings, encompassing integrable models that describe particles with pairwise interactions.

The intersection of these two systems leads to the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (MR) systems, which encapsulate the properties of both and provide a unified framework for studying integrable models with rich algebraic structures. These systems have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of integrable models and their applications across various fields.

#### Motivation

Despite the substantial progress made in the study of MR systems, there remains a significant scope for generalization. The classical MR systems, while powerful, are limited in their ability to encompass more complex interactions and broader classes of symmetries that arise in modern mathematical physics and representation theory. This motivates the need to extend the MR systems to what we term Generalized Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (GMR) systems.

The GMR systems aim to capture a wider variety of integrable models, incorporating additional parameters and interaction terms that reflect more intricate physical and mathematical phenomena. By developing a comprehensive theory for GMR systems, we can deepen our understanding of integrable models and open new avenues for research and application.

#### Literature Review

The study of integrable systems has a rich history, with significant contributions from various branches of mathematics and physics. The Macdonald polynomials, introduced by Ian Macdonald, generalize several classical polynomial families and have deep connections with symmetric functions, representation theory, and algebraic combinatorics. These polynomials form the basis for the Macdonald systems, which are integrable models associated with these polynomials.

Ruijsenaars systems, introduced by Simon Ruijsenaars, extend the Calogero-Moser systems to relativistic settings, providing integrable models with significant applications in quantum mechanics and statistical physics. These systems are characterized by their pairwise interaction terms and relativistic dynamics.

The intersection of these two systems leads to the Macdonald-Ruijsenaars systems, which have been extensively studied for their integrability and connections to special functions and orthogonal polynomials. Recent research has focused on various extensions and generalizations of these systems, including studies on their spectral properties, Hamiltonian formulations, and algebraic structures.
