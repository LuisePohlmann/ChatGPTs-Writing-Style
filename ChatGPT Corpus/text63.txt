### Abstract

In this study, we explore the preparation and characterization of a dual-layer carbon film on a 6H-SiC wafer. The dual-layer carbon film is created using a carbide-derived carbon (CDC) process followed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The CDC process involves the selective extraction of silicon from the SiC wafer, leaving behind a porous carbon layer, which is then coated with a thin, dense carbon film using CVD. This method aims to enhance the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of the SiC wafer for potential applications in electronic devices. Comprehensive characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements, are employed to analyze the structural, morphological, and functional properties of the dual-layer carbon film. Our findings demonstrate that the dual-layer carbon film exhibits improved structural integrity, electrical conductivity, and thermal stability compared to single-layer carbon films, indicating its potential for advanced electronic applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor material known for its exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, and chemical inertness, making it a highly desirable material for high-power, high-frequency, and high-temperature electronic devices. The 6H polytype of SiC, in particular, is widely used in various applications due to its favorable electronic properties. However, to further enhance its performance and broaden its application scope, surface modification techniques are often employed.

One promising approach to modifying the surface properties of SiC wafers is the formation of carbon films. Carbon films, due to their high thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and mechanical robustness, can significantly enhance the functional properties of SiC substrates. Traditional methods of carbon film deposition, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), are commonly used to produce high-quality carbon films. However, combining CVD with other processes can further improve the film's characteristics.

The carbide-derived carbon (CDC) process is a technique that involves the selective extraction of non-carbon elements from carbide compounds, resulting in the formation of porous carbon structures. This process, when applied to SiC, can create a porous carbon layer on the wafer surface. Subsequent deposition of a dense carbon layer using CVD can produce a dual-layer carbon film with unique properties that may outperform single-layer carbon films.
