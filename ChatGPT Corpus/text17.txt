### Abstract

This paper investigates the emissions of minor and trace elements from post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) processes in coal-fired power plants, combining experimental data with equilibrium calculations to provide a comprehensive analysis. The study aims to identify the specific elements released during the PCC process, understand their behavior, and evaluate the effectiveness of PCC technologies in mitigating these emissions. Experimental work involved sampling and analyzing flue gas streams before and after CO2 capture, focusing on elements such as mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se). Equilibrium calculations were performed to predict the speciation and partitioning of these elements under different conditions. Our results indicate that while PCC can significantly reduce CO2 emissions, it may also alter the emission profiles of certain trace elements. The findings underscore the need for integrated emission control strategies that address both CO2 and trace elements to minimize environmental impacts.

### Introduction

#### Background

Coal-fired power plants are among the largest sources of CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas levels. To mitigate climate change, post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) technologies have been developed and implemented in many plants worldwide. PCC involves capturing CO2 from flue gases produced during combustion, which can then be stored or utilized in various applications. While the primary focus of PCC is on reducing CO2 emissions, the process can also influence the emission profiles of other pollutants, including minor and trace elements.

Trace elements such as mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se) are present in coal and can be released into the atmosphere during combustion. These elements pose significant environmental and health risks due to their toxicity and persistence. Understanding how PCC technologies affect the emissions of these elements is crucial for developing comprehensive emission control strategies that address both CO2 and trace pollutants.

#### Motivation

Despite the benefits of PCC in reducing CO2 emissions, there is limited understanding of its impact on the emissions of minor and trace elements. Previous studies have primarily focused on the capture and sequestration of CO2, with less attention given to the behavior of other pollutants during the capture process. This gap in knowledge presents a significant challenge for the comprehensive assessment and optimization of PCC technologies.

The motivation for this study arises from the need to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the emissions of minor and trace elements from PCC processes. By combining experimental measurements with equilibrium calculations, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the behavior of these elements during PCC and their potential environmental impacts.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Identify Emitted Elements**: Determine the specific minor and trace elements emitted during the PCC process in coal-fired power plants.
2. **Analyze Emission Profiles**: Understand how PCC influences the emission profiles of these elements compared to conventional coal combustion without CO2 capture.
3. **Evaluate Speciation and Partitioning**: Use equilibrium calculations to predict the speciation and partitioning of trace elements under different conditions within the PCC process.
4. **Assess Environmental Impact**: Evaluate the potential environmental impacts of trace element emissions from PCC processes and suggest mitigation strategies.

The scope of this study includes both experimental analysis and computational modeling. We focus on key trace elements known for their environmental and health risks and analyze their behavior in the context of PCC technologies.

#### Methodology

1. **Experimental Setup**: Conduct experiments in a coal-fired power plant equipped with PCC technology. Collect flue gas samples before and after the CO2 capture process.
2. **Elemental Analysis**: Analyze the flue gas samples for trace elements using techniques such as Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).
3. **Equilibrium Calculations**: Perform thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to predict the speciation and partitioning of trace elements under various conditions encountered in the PCC process.
4. **Data Analysis**: Compare experimental results with equilibrium predictions to understand the behavior of trace elements during PCC. Assess the implications for emission control and environmental impact.

#### Literature Review

Previous research has extensively documented the emissions of trace elements from coal combustion. However, studies specifically addressing the impact of PCC on these emissions are sparse. Notable studies include those by Sj√∂blom et al. (2010) and Munson et al. (2015), who explored the fate of trace elements in carbon capture processes but primarily focused on pilot-scale experiments and limited elements. Our study aims to build on this foundation by providing a more comprehensive analysis, incorporating both experimental data from full-scale operations and detailed equilibrium modeling.

#### Importance of Addressing Trace Element Emissions

Addressing trace element emissions from PCC processes is essential for several reasons:

1. **Environmental Protection**: Trace elements such as Hg, As, and Se are highly toxic and can contaminate air, water, and soil, posing significant environmental risks.
2. **Health Implications**: These elements can cause serious health issues, including neurological damage, cancer, and respiratory problems, particularly in vulnerable populations.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Understanding the emissions of trace elements is crucial for ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and standards, which are becoming increasingly stringent.
4. **Optimizing PCC Technologies**: By understanding how PCC influences trace element emissions, we can develop more effective emission control strategies that optimize the overall performance of these technologies.

#### Key Theoretical Concepts

1. **Post-Combustion CO2 Capture**: The process of capturing CO2 from flue gases after combustion, typically using chemical solvents such as amines.
2. **Trace Elements in Coal**: Minor elements present in coal that can be released during combustion and pose environmental and health risks.
3. **Speciation and Partitioning**: The distribution of trace elements among different chemical forms and phases, influenced by temperature, pressure, and chemical environment.
4. **Thermodynamic Equilibrium**: The state at which the chemical composition of a system is stable, used to predict the behavior of elements under specific conditions.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

To illustrate the practical implications of our findings, consider the case of a coal-fired power plant implementing PCC technology. Our study could help plant operators understand how the process affects the emissions of specific trace elements, enabling them to adjust operating conditions to minimize these emissions. For example, if we find that certain elements are more likely to volatilize and escape capture at higher temperatures, operators could adjust the temperature profile of the capture process to mitigate this risk.

#### Results and Discussion

The results section will present the main findings from our experimental analysis and equilibrium calculations. We will discuss the concentrations and speciation of trace elements before and after PCC, highlighting any significant changes in emission profiles. The discussion will interpret these findings in the context of existing literature, explore potential mechanisms driving the observed behaviors, and assess the implications for emission control and environmental protection.

#### Conclusion

This study provides new insights into the emissions of minor and trace elements from post-combustion CO2 capture processes in coal-fired power plants. Our findings indicate that while PCC is effective in reducing CO2 emissions, it can also alter the emission profiles of certain trace elements. These results underscore the need for integrated emission control strategies that address both CO2 and trace elements to minimize environmental impacts. By combining experimental data with equilibrium calculations, we offer a comprehensive analysis that can inform the optimization of PCC technologies and enhance environmental protection.

#### Future Work

Future research directions include:

1. **Extended Elemental Analysis**: Expanding the scope of trace elements analyzed to include a broader range of pollutants.
2. **Mechanistic Studies**: Investigating the underlying mechanisms that influence the speciation and partitioning of trace elements during PCC.
3. **Technology Optimization**: Developing and testing new PCC technologies and operational strategies to minimize trace element emissions.
4. **Regulatory Frameworks**: Informing the development of regulatory frameworks that address both CO2 and trace element emissions from coal-fired power plants.

By addressing these areas, future work can build on the findings of this study to further enhance the understanding and management of trace element emissions from PCC processes, ultimately improving the environmental performance of coal-fired power plants.
