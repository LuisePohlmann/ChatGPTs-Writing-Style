### Abstract

The minority carrier lifetime in silicon photovoltaics is a crucial parameter influencing the efficiency of solar cells. This study investigates the impact of oxygen precipitation on minority carrier lifetime in silicon-based photovoltaic devices. Oxygen precipitation, a process where oxygen atoms within the silicon lattice aggregate to form silicon-oxygen precipitates, can significantly alter carrier dynamics. Through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical modeling, we examine how different levels of oxygen precipitation affect carrier lifetime and, consequently, the overall performance of silicon photovoltaics. Techniques such as time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and carrier lifetime measurements are employed to characterize the effects of precipitation on minority carrier behavior. Our findings reveal a complex relationship between oxygen precipitation and minority carrier lifetime, with implications for optimizing silicon solar cell performance. This research provides insights into managing oxygen precipitation to enhance the efficiency of silicon photovoltaics.

### Introduction

#### Background

Silicon photovoltaics are a cornerstone of modern solar energy technology, providing a reliable and efficient means of converting sunlight into electrical energy. The performance of silicon solar cells is influenced by various factors, one of the most critical being the minority carrier lifetime. Minority carrier lifetime refers to the average time that charge carriers (electrons or holes) remain in the material before recombining. Longer minority carrier lifetimes generally lead to higher photovoltaic efficiency, as it allows for better collection of charge carriers generated by absorbed light.

Oxygen precipitation is a phenomenon observed in silicon wafers, particularly those used in photovoltaic cells. During the thermal processing of silicon, oxygen atoms within the crystal lattice can cluster to form precipitates, which are silicon-oxygen compounds. These precipitates can trap charge carriers or create recombination centers, thereby affecting the minority carrier lifetime. Understanding and managing the impact of oxygen precipitation is crucial for optimizing the performance of silicon photovoltaics.
