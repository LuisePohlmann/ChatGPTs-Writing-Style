### Abstract

Coffee agroforestry systems (CAFS) have emerged as a sustainable agricultural practice with potential environmental benefits, including the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into soil organic carbon (SOC). This study examines the capacity of CAFS to function as carbon sinks, contributing to climate change mitigation. By analyzing various CAFS setups in different geographic locations and comparing them to monoculture coffee systems, we assess SOC levels and carbon sequestration rates. Using field measurements, soil sampling, and modeling approaches, we quantify the carbon sequestration potential of these systems. Our findings indicate that well-managed CAFS can significantly increase SOC, suggesting that they are effective strategies for atmospheric CO2 sequestration. This research provides insights into optimizing CAFS for maximum carbon sequestration, promoting sustainable coffee production, and contributing to global carbon management efforts.

### Introduction

#### Background

Climate change, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Agricultural practices play a dual role in this context: they are both contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and potential mitigators through carbon sequestration. The latter involves capturing atmospheric CO2 and storing it in vegetation, soils, and biomass. Among various agricultural systems, agroforestry—a land-use management system that combines trees with crops or livestock—has shown significant promise for carbon sequestration.

Coffee agroforestry systems (CAFS) are a prominent example of agroforestry that integrates coffee plants with shade trees. These systems not only enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services but also have the potential to sequester atmospheric CO2 into soil organic carbon (SOC). The incorporation of trees into coffee plantations can improve soil structure, increase organic matter, and enhance microbial activity, all of which contribute to higher SOC levels. However, the extent to which CAFS can sequester carbon compared to traditional monoculture coffee systems remains under-explored.

4. **Global Carbon Management**: Contributes to global efforts in managing carbon budgets and developing sustainable land-use strategies.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)**: The carbon component of organic compounds found within soil, which is crucial for soil fertility and carbon sequestration.
2. **Carbon Sequestration**: The process of capturing and storing atmospheric CO2 in plants, soils, and other carbon sinks.
3. **Agroforestry**: A land-use management system that integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes to enhance biodiversity, soil health, and carbon sequestration.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example application of this study is in the development of sustainable coffee certification programs. By incorporating criteria related to SOC levels and carbon sequestration, certification programs can incentivize farmers to adopt CAFS, thereby promoting climate-friendly coffee production.

Another application is in climate policy. The findings of this study can support the inclusion of agroforestry practices in national and international climate strategies, providing a viable pathway for achieving carbon reduction targets.
