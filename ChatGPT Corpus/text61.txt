### Abstract

The impact of temperature on CO2 storage is a critical factor influencing the efficiency and safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. This paper investigates the influence of temperature variations on CO2 storage at the Ketzin site, Germany, through fluid flow simulations and seismic data analysis. The Ketzin site serves as Europe's longest-running onshore CO2 storage research facility, providing invaluable data for understanding subsurface CO2 behavior. Our study integrates numerical simulations of fluid flow with seismic monitoring to assess how temperature changes affect CO2 plume migration, reservoir pressure, and overall storage stability. Results indicate that temperature fluctuations can significantly alter CO2 density and viscosity, impacting the extent of CO2 plume spread and the pressure regime within the reservoir. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating thermal effects into CO2 storage models to ensure accurate predictions and effective management of storage sites.

### Introduction

#### Background

Climate change driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Among various strategies to mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising solution. CCS involves capturing CO2 from industrial sources, transporting it to storage sites, and injecting it into deep geological formations for long-term sequestration. The effectiveness and safety of CO2 storage are paramount to the success of CCS, necessitating thorough understanding and careful management of subsurface processes.

The Ketzin site in Germany, operational since 2008, is a pioneering CCS project that has provided critical insights into the behavior of CO2 in geological formations. Extensive monitoring, including seismic surveys, has been conducted to track CO2 plume migration and assess the integrity of the storage site. While considerable research has focused on the chemical and mechanical interactions within the storage reservoir, the thermal effects on CO2 behavior have received comparatively less attention.

Temperature variations can influence CO2 storage in multiple ways. Changes in temperature affect the density and viscosity of CO2, which in turn influence its mobility and distribution within the reservoir. Additionally, temperature fluctuations can alter the physical properties of the surrounding rock and fluids, impacting the overall storage stability. Therefore, understanding the impact of temperature on CO2 storage is crucial for developing accurate models and ensuring the safe and efficient operation of CCS projects.
