### Abstract

The performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is significantly influenced by the morphology of the active layer, which affects charge transport and recombination processes. This study focuses on the control of morphology in co-evaporated BHJ solar cells, exploring various strategies to optimize the active layer's structure and improve device efficiency. By systematically varying deposition parameters and incorporating different processing techniques, we investigate the effects of morphology on the optical and electrical properties of the cells.

### Introduction

#### Background

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are a class of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices that have gained significant attention due to their potential for flexible, low-cost, and high-efficiency energy conversion. In a BHJ solar cell, a blend of donor and acceptor materials forms a composite active layer that facilitates efficient charge separation and transport. The morphology of this active layer plays a critical role in determining the overall performance of the device.

In co-evaporated BHJ solar cells, the active layer is deposited by simultaneously evaporating donor and acceptor materials. This deposition method offers precise control over the composition and structure of the active layer. However, achieving the optimal morphology for maximum device efficiency remains a challenge. The morphology of the active layer can influence several key factors, including the extent of phase separation, the distribution of donor and acceptor domains, and the interfacial properties between these domains.

Controlling the morphology of the active layer involves adjusting various deposition parameters and processing conditions. Techniques such as thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, and the use of surfactants or additives can be employed to tailor the film structure. Understanding how these factors affect the morphology and, consequently, the performance of co-evaporated BHJ solar cells is essential for advancing organic photovoltaic technology.
