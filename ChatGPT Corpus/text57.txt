### Abstract

SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture) is a groundbreaking neuromimetic computing system designed to simulate large-scale neural networks in real-time. Given the constraints of power consumption and physical space inherent in such large-scale systems, ensuring fault tolerance is critical for maintaining reliable performance. This paper investigates the fault tolerance mechanisms employed in SpiNNaker, focusing on their efficacy and efficiency within the constraints of power and area. Through a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical evaluation, we explore how SpiNNaker’s architecture manages faults at both the hardware and software levels. Our findings demonstrate that SpiNNaker effectively balances the trade-offs between fault tolerance, power consumption, and area efficiency, providing a robust platform for neural network simulations. These insights can guide the design of future neuromimetic architectures facing similar constraints.

### Introduction

#### Background

The human brain is a paragon of computational efficiency and fault tolerance, operating reliably despite the failure of individual neurons and synapses. Emulating such capabilities in artificial systems is the holy grail of neuromorphic engineering, which seeks to design hardware that mimics the architecture and function of neural networks. SpiNNaker, short for Spiking Neural Network Architecture, represents a significant step toward this goal. It is designed to support the real-time simulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are computational models that closely resemble biological neural networks.

One of the core challenges in developing such large-scale neuromimetic systems is ensuring fault tolerance without compromising on power and area constraints. Fault tolerance is crucial because even a single malfunctioning component can significantly degrade the performance of neural simulations. However, achieving high levels of fault tolerance typically involves redundancy and error correction mechanisms, which can increase power consumption and require additional physical space—both of which are limited in large-scale systems like SpiNNaker.
