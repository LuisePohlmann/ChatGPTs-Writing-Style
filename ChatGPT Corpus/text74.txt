### Abstract

This study investigates the impact of incorporating dense, thin zinc oxide (ZnO) layers into inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells to enhance their performance. By employing atmospheric atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique renowned for its precision in film deposition, we have developed ZnO layers with exceptional uniformity and density. These layers were integrated into the inverted BHJ solar cell architecture, which is characterized by its unique layer arrangement compared to traditional configurations. The incorporation of ZnO layers is evaluated in terms of their effects on charge carrier dynamics, device stability, and overall solar cell efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of dense ZnO layers significantly improves the photovoltaic performance of the inverted BHJ solar cells, leading to enhanced power conversion efficiencies. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of these advanced solar cells, highlighting the potential of ZnO layers to push the boundaries of organic photovoltaic technology.

### Introduction

#### Background

The quest for efficient and cost-effective solar energy solutions has driven extensive research into organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies, particularly bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. BHJ solar cells are favored for their simplicity and potential for high efficiency, due to the favorable morphology of the donor-acceptor materials that facilitates efficient charge separation and transport. The inverted BHJ architecture, which reverses the traditional layer arrangement, offers several advantages, including improved stability and compatibility with various substrates.

One of the critical challenges in optimizing inverted BHJ solar cells is the enhancement of charge extraction and transport. Zinc oxide (ZnO), a widely studied semiconductor with excellent electrical and optical properties, has emerged as a promising material for improving the performance of photovoltaic devices. When deposited as a thin, dense layer, ZnO can act as an effective electron transport layer (ETL), potentially leading to enhanced charge extraction and overall device efficiency.

Atmospheric atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique that allows for the precise deposition of thin films with atomic-scale control over thickness and uniformity. This technique is particularly well-suited for depositing ZnO layers, as it enables the creation of dense, high-quality films that can significantly impact the performance of solar cells.
