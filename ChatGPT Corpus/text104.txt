### Abstract

Tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, represent a significant challenge in neuroscience due to their complex pathology and limited therapeutic options. Recent advancements in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have enabled the generation of patient-specific neurons, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of tauopathies and potential therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the genetic correction of tauopathy phenotypes in neurons derived from human iPSCs. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to correct pathogenic tau mutations in iPSCs derived from patients with tauopathies and differentiated these corrected iPSCs into neurons. Comparative analyses of corrected and uncorrected neuronal models were conducted to assess the impact of genetic correction on tau pathology, including tau aggregation, neurodegeneration, and associated cellular dysfunctions. Our results demonstrate that genetic correction significantly reduces tau pathology and restores cellular function, highlighting the potential of gene editing technologies in ameliorating tauopathy-related deficits. This study provides a foundation for developing gene-based therapies for tauopathies and underscores the utility of iPSC-derived neuronal models in advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

### Introduction

#### Background

Tauopathies encompass a range of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal tau protein aggregation in the brain. This pathological feature is commonly associated with disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms neurofibrillary tangles, which are believed to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies is crucial for developing effective treatments.

**Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)**

The advent of iPSC technology has revolutionized the study of genetic diseases by enabling the generation of patient-specific cells that retain the genetic makeup of the donor. iPSCs can be differentiated into various cell types, including neurons, providing a powerful platform to model neurodegenerative diseases in vitro. This approach allows researchers to study disease mechanisms, identify potential therapeutic targets, and test new treatments using patient-derived cells.

**Genetic Correction Technologies**

CRISPR/Cas9 and other gene editing technologies offer precise methods for correcting genetic mutations associated with disease. By targeting specific mutations in the genome, these technologies can potentially reverse pathogenic processes and restore normal cellular function. Applying genetic correction to iPSC-derived neurons offers an innovative approach to understanding and treating tauopathies.

#### Problem Statement

Tauopathies are complex and multifactorial, involving genetic mutations, tau hyperphosphorylation, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Current models of tauopathies often lack the ability to directly test the effects of genetic corrections on disease phenotypes. While iPSC technology provides an excellent model for studying tauopathies, there is limited research on the application of genetic correction strategies to these models.

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. **To generate and characterize human iPSC-derived neuronal models of tauopathies with pathogenic tau mutations.**
2. **To apply CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to correct tau mutations in iPSCs and assess the impact of genetic correction on tau pathology.**
3. **To compare the cellular and molecular phenotypes of corrected and uncorrected neuronal models to evaluate the efficacy of genetic correction.**
4. **To provide insights into the potential of gene editing technologies for developing therapeutic strategies for tauopathies.**

#### Literature Review

**Tauopathies and Tau Protein**

Tauopathies are characterized by the abnormal aggregation of tau protein, which impairs neuronal function and contributes to neurodegeneration. Hyperphosphorylated tau forms neurofibrillary tangles that disrupt microtubule stability, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Various tau mutations have been identified in familial tauopathies, providing insights into the genetic basis of these disorders.

**iPSC Models of Neurodegenerative Diseases**

iPSCs have been utilized to model a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies. These models allow for the examination of disease mechanisms at the cellular level and the evaluation of potential therapies. iPSC-derived neurons from patients with tauopathies exhibit key features of tau pathology, including tau aggregation and neurodegeneration.

**Gene Editing Technologies**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool for genome editing that allows for the precise correction of genetic mutations. This technology has been applied to various genetic disorders, including those involving tau protein. Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to correct mutations in iPSCs and restore normal cellular function.
