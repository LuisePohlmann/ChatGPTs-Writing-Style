### Abstract

Grain boundaries (GBs) play a crucial role in determining the mechanical and physical properties of polycrystalline materials. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an effective severe plastic deformation technique that refines the microstructure of metals, leading to a significant increase in grain boundary area and associated defect structures. This study investigates the grain boundary excess volume and defect annealing in copper subjected to HPT. Using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we analyze the microstructural evolution, quantify the excess volume, and assess the thermal stability of defects. Our results reveal that HPT processing significantly increases the grain boundary excess volume and induces a high density of defects, which are progressively annealed out at elevated temperatures. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of defect formation and recovery in severely deformed copper, contributing to the broader understanding of the relationship between severe plastic deformation, microstructural refinement, and material properties.

### Introduction

#### Background

Grain boundaries are critical interfaces in polycrystalline materials that significantly influence their mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. The properties of grain boundaries are largely determined by their atomic structure and associated defects, such as dislocations and vacancies. In recent years, severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques, such as high-pressure torsion (HPT), have gained considerable attention for their ability to produce ultrafine-grained and nanocrystalline materials with enhanced properties. HPT involves the application of high pressure and torsional strain, resulting in substantial grain refinement and the introduction of a high density of defects and grain boundaries.

Copper, a material widely used in electrical, thermal, and structural applications, has been extensively studied under various SPD conditions. Understanding the effects of HPT on the microstructure and properties of copper is essential for optimizing its performance in practical applications. In particular, the grain boundary excess volume, which is the additional free volume associated with grain boundaries, and the annealing behavior of defects introduced during HPT processing, are of significant interest. These factors influence the mechanical strength, thermal stability, and overall performance of the material.
