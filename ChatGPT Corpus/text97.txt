### Abstract

Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, predominantly affecting peripheral nerves. The generation of disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers a promising avenue for modeling FAP and developing targeted therapies. This study reports the successful reprogramming of fibroblasts from FAP patients into iPSCs. These FAP-specific iPSCs retained the genetic mutations associated with the disease and demonstrated typical pluripotency markers. Differentiation into peripheral neurons allowed for the study of amyloid deposition and neuronal dysfunction in vitro. Our findings provide a valuable resource for understanding FAP pathology and screening potential therapeutic compounds.

### Introduction

#### Background

Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene, leading to the production of misfolded TTR proteins. These proteins aggregate into amyloid fibrils, which are deposited in various tissues, particularly the peripheral nerves, resulting in progressive neuropathy. FAP has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, with symptoms including sensory and motor deficits, autonomic dysfunction, and, ultimately, organ failure. Despite advancements in understanding the molecular basis of FAP, effective treatments remain limited.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a revolutionary tool in biomedical research, providing an unlimited source of patient-specific cells for disease modeling, drug screening, and potential cell-based therapies. iPSCs are generated by reprogramming somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, to a pluripotent state through the expression of key transcription factors. These cells can differentiate into various cell types, making them invaluable for studying disease mechanisms in a controlled, patient-specific context.

#### Problem Statement

Current models for studying FAP are limited and often fail to recapitulate the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Animal models, while useful, do not fully mimic human disease processes, and primary human cell cultures are difficult to obtain and maintain. There is a critical need for reliable, patient-specific models that can be used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying FAP and to screen for potential therapeutics.

The development of FAP-specific iPSCs represents a significant advancement in this area. These cells can be differentiated into relevant cell types, such as peripheral neurons, providing a physiologically relevant system for studying amyloid deposition and neuronal dysfunction. Additionally, FAP-specific iPSCs allow for the investigation of patient-specific genetic backgrounds and their influence on disease progression and treatment responses.

#### Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Generate iPSCs from fibroblasts of patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.**
2. **Characterize the pluripotency and genetic stability of the generated iPSCs.**
3. **Differentiate the FAP-specific iPSCs into peripheral neurons and assess amyloid deposition and neuronal dysfunction.**
4. **Establish a platform for drug screening and therapeutic development using FAP-specific iPSCs.**

#### Literature Review

The reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs was first achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues in 2006, using a combination of transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). Since then, iPSCs have been generated from patients with various genetic disorders, providing insights into disease mechanisms and facilitating the development of novel therapies. FAP-specific iPSCs have the potential to model the disease more accurately than existing systems, given their ability to replicate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the patient's condition.

Previous studies have shown that iPSCs can be differentiated into various neuronal subtypes, including peripheral neurons, which are particularly relevant for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as FAP. These differentiated cells exhibit many of the properties of primary neurons, including the ability to form functional synapses and respond to neurotrophic factors. Importantly, iPSC-derived neurons from patients with neurodegenerative diseases have been used to model disease-specific pathologies, such as amyloid-beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.

#### Methodology

**Cell Reprogramming**

Fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of FAP patients with confirmed TTR mutations. These fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a non-integrating episomal vector system expressing the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). Reprogrammed cells were cultured in defined conditions and assessed for pluripotency markers.

**Characterization of iPSCs**

The generated iPSCs were characterized using immunocytochemistry to detect pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, SSEA-4, and Tra-1-60). Pluripotency was further confirmed through the formation of teratomas in immunocompromised mice and differentiation into the three germ layers in vitro. Genetic stability was assessed by karyotyping and sequencing to confirm the presence of TTR mutations.

**Differentiation into Peripheral Neurons**

FAP-specific iPSCs were differentiated into peripheral neurons using a defined differentiation protocol. Neuronal identity was confirmed through immunostaining for neuronal markers (TUJ1, MAP2, and PGP9.5). Functional assays, including electrophysiological recordings and neurite outgrowth analysis, were performed to assess neuronal functionality.

**Assessment of Amyloid Deposition and Neuronal Dysfunction**

Amyloid deposition was assessed using Congo red and Thioflavin T staining, as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize fibril formation. Neuronal dysfunction was evaluated through measures of cell viability, synaptic integrity, and electrophysiological properties. Comparative analyses were performed between FAP-specific neurons and healthy control neurons.

**Drug Screening Platform**

A high-throughput screening platform was established using the differentiated neurons to test potential therapeutic compounds. Compounds were assessed for their ability to reduce amyloid deposition and improve neuronal function. Hits from the screening were further validated in dose-response studies and mechanistic assays.

#### Results

**Generation and Characterization of FAP-specific iPSCs**

Fibroblasts from FAP patients were successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs. The iPSCs exhibited typical pluripotency markers and formed teratomas containing tissues from all three germ layers. Karyotyping confirmed genetic stability, and sequencing verified the retention of TTR mutations.

**Differentiation into Peripheral Neurons**

The FAP-specific iPSCs efficiently differentiated into peripheral neurons, expressing relevant neuronal markers and demonstrating functional properties. These neurons formed networks and exhibited action potentials, confirming their neuronal identity.

**Amyloid Deposition and Neuronal Dysfunction**

Differentiated neurons from FAP-specific iPSCs showed significant amyloid deposition compared to controls. TEM confirmed the presence of amyloid fibrils. Neuronal dysfunction was evidenced by reduced cell viability, impaired synaptic integrity, and altered electrophysiological properties.

**Drug Screening**

The high-throughput screening identified several compounds that reduced amyloid deposition and improved neuronal function in FAP-specific neurons. These compounds are potential candidates for further development as therapeutic agents for FAP.

#### Discussion

This study demonstrates the successful generation of FAP-specific iPSCs and their differentiation into peripheral neurons. The resulting neurons provide a relevant model for studying FAP pathology, particularly amyloid deposition and neuronal dysfunction. The established drug screening platform offers a powerful tool for identifying and validating potential therapeutics.

The use of patient-specific iPSCs allows for the investigation of disease mechanisms in a genetically relevant context, providing insights that may not be achievable with other models. The findings from this study pave the way for further research into FAP and the development of targeted treatments.

#### Conclusion

The generation of FAP-specific iPSCs and their differentiation into peripheral neurons represent a significant advancement in modeling familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. This study establishes a robust platform for studying disease mechanisms and screening potential therapeutics, contributing to the ongoing efforts to develop effective treatments for FAP. Future work will focus on optimizing the differentiation protocols, validating identified compounds, and exploring the potential for personalized medicine approaches in treating FAP.
