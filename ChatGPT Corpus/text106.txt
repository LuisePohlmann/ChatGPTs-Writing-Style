### Abstract

Foregut stem cells, which give rise to a range of specialized epithelial tissues within the gastrointestinal tract, represent a crucial component in understanding and treating diseases of the digestive system. Generating these cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers a promising avenue for research and therapeutic applications. This study presents a novel approach for generating multipotent foregut stem cells from hPSCs, focusing on the optimization of differentiation protocols and the characterization of the resulting cells. Using a combination of growth factor-induced signaling pathways and tissue-specific transcription factors, we successfully derived multipotent foregut stem cells that exhibit key features of in vivo foregut progenitors. Our results demonstrate that these cells possess the ability to differentiate into various foregut lineages, including gastric, duodenal, and pancreatic progenitor cells, and exhibit potential for tissue regeneration and disease modeling. This work provides a foundation for future studies aimed at developing advanced models for gastrointestinal diseases and exploring regenerative therapies.

### Introduction

#### Background

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex organ system with intricate structures and diverse cell types that play vital roles in digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune function. The foregut, which forms the upper part of the GI tract, gives rise to several critical tissues, including the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas. Understanding the biology of foregut stem cells and their differentiation potential is essential for advancing our knowledge of GI development and for developing regenerative therapies for related diseases.

**Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSCs)**

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have the remarkable ability to differentiate into virtually any cell type in the body. This pluripotency makes hPSCs an invaluable tool for studying developmental biology and for generating specific cell types for research and therapeutic purposes. However, deriving specific cell types, such as foregut stem cells, from hPSCs requires carefully designed differentiation protocols to mimic developmental cues accurately.

**Foregut Stem Cells**

Foregut stem cells are multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into various specialized cell types within the foregut epithelium. These cells are crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the foregut tissues and have the potential to be used in regenerative medicine and disease modeling. Despite their importance, the generation of functional foregut stem cells from hPSCs has been challenging due to the complex signaling pathways and transcriptional networks involved in their development.

#### Objectives

This study aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **To develop and optimize a differentiation protocol to generate multipotent foregut stem cells from hPSCs.**
2. **To characterize the generated foregut stem cells in terms of their morphology, gene expression profile, and differentiation potential.**
3. **To evaluate the functional capabilities of these cells, including their ability to differentiate into various foregut lineages and their potential for use in disease modeling and regenerative medicine.**

#### Literature Review

**Differentiation Protocols for hPSCs**

Recent advances in stem cell biology have led to the development of various differentiation protocols to generate specific cell types from hPSCs. For instance, protocols for generating hematopoietic, neural, and cardiac cells have been established and optimized. These protocols often involve the sequential application of specific growth factors, small molecules, and transcription factors to guide the differentiation process. Similarly, generating foregut stem cells from hPSCs requires a detailed understanding of the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that govern foregut development.

**Foregut Development and Stem Cells**

The foregut develops from the early embryonic endoderm and is regulated by a series of developmental signals, including Wnt, FGF, and BMP pathways. Transcription factors such as Sox2, HNF4α, and PDX1 play critical roles in defining foregut progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into specific foregut tissues. Understanding these developmental cues is crucial for designing effective differentiation protocols to generate functional foregut stem cells from hPSCs.

**Applications of Foregut Stem Cells**

Foregut stem cells have potential applications in several areas, including regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery. For example, generating functional gastric or pancreatic cells from hPSCs could provide new treatments for conditions such as gastritis, gastric cancer, and diabetes. Additionally, foregut stem cells can be used to create in vitro models of GI diseases, enabling researchers to study disease mechanisms and test potential therapies.

#### Methodology

**Cell Lines and Culture Conditions**

We used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as starting materials for differentiation. The hPSCs were maintained under standard conditions and characterized for pluripotency markers before initiating the differentiation process.

**Differentiation Protocol**

1. **Induction of Foregut Endoderm:** hPSCs were first induced to form definitive endoderm using a combination of specific growth factors and small molecules, including Activin A and Wnt3a. The induction was monitored through the expression of early foregut markers such as SOX17 and FOXA2.

2. **Foregut Progenitor Formation:** The definitive endoderm was further cultured in medium supplemented with FGF4 and BMP4 to promote the development of foregut progenitors. The expression of foregut-specific transcription factors such as SOX2 and HNF4α was used to confirm the successful generation of foregut progenitors.

3. **Maturation and Expansion:** The foregut progenitors were then cultured in conditions that support the maturation of foregut stem cells, including the addition of additional growth factors and matrix components. Cell expansion and functional characterization were performed at various stages of differentiation.

**Characterization of Foregut Stem Cells**

1. **Molecular Characterization:** The expression of key foregut markers and differentiation genes was assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. This analysis included markers such as SOX2, HNF4α, and PDX1.

2. **Morphological Assessment:** The morphology of the differentiated cells was examined using light microscopy and electron microscopy to assess the formation of foregut-like structures and cell ultrastructure.

3. **Functional Assays:** Functional assays included the evaluation of the cells' ability to differentiate into specific foregut lineages, such as gastric, duodenal, and pancreatic cells, using lineage-specific markers and functional tests.

**Applications and Validation**

1. **Disease Modeling:** The potential use of the generated foregut stem cells for disease modeling was explored by creating in vitro models of foregut-related diseases and assessing the cellular responses to various stimuli.

2. **Regenerative Potential:** The regenerative potential of the foregut stem cells was evaluated through transplantation studies in animal models and the assessment of tissue integration and functional recovery.

We successfully generated multipotent foregut stem cells from hPSCs using our optimized differentiation protocol. The cells exhibited characteristic morphology and expressed key foregut markers, confirming their identity as foregut progenitors.

**Characterization of Differentiated Cells**

1. **Molecular Profile:** The differentiated cells expressed high levels of foregut-specific transcription factors and genes associated with various foregut tissues, including the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas. This profile was consistent with the expected characteristics of multipotent foregut stem cells.

2. **Morphology:** The cells displayed a foregut-like epithelial morphology and formed structures resembling gastrointestinal tissues. Electron microscopy revealed well-defined cellular structures and organelles typical of mature foregut cells.

3. **Functional Capabilities:** The cells demonstrated the ability to differentiate into gastric, duodenal, and pancreatic progenitor cells, as evidenced by the expression of lineage-specific markers and functional assays.

**Applications and Future Directions**
