### Abstract

The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) represents a significant period of rapid global warming approximately 56 million years ago, characterized by substantial carbon release and notable environmental changes. This paper examines the marine and terrestrial environmental shifts in Northwest Europe preceding the PETM, aiming to identify the precursors to the profound climatic and ecological transformations associated with this epoch. By integrating paleontological, geochemical, and sedimentological data from various Northwest European sites, we reconstruct the regional environmental dynamics leading up to the PETM. Our findings indicate a complex interplay of factors, including volcanic activity, changes in ocean circulation, and terrestrial vegetation shifts, which collectively contributed to the destabilization of carbon reservoirs and set the stage for the ensuing global climatic perturbation. Understanding these pre-PETM environmental changes provides critical insights into the mechanisms driving rapid climate change and offers valuable analogs for contemporary and future climate scenarios.

### Introduction

The transition between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs, approximately 56 million years ago, is marked by one of the most significant global climatic events in Earth's history: the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). This event is characterized by a rapid rise in global temperatures, estimated at 5-8Â°C over a few thousand years, accompanied by a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere and oceans. The PETM had profound impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems, driving widespread extinction and evolutionary turnovers. As modern society grapples with anthropogenic climate change, the PETM serves as a crucial ancient analog, providing insights into the potential consequences of rapid carbon release and warming.

This paper focuses on the environmental changes in Northwest Europe preceding the PETM, a region that offers a rich and diverse geological record essential for understanding the dynamics of this climatic transition. Northwest Europe, including areas such as the North Sea Basin, the London-Paris Basin, and the Spitsbergen region, provides a variety of sedimentary archives that capture the prelude to the PETM in both marine and terrestrial settings. By examining these records, we aim to elucidate the processes and conditions that set the stage for the dramatic climate shift at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary.

#### Geological and Climatic Context

The late Paleocene was a period of significant tectonic, volcanic, and climatic activity. The North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) experienced extensive volcanic activity, which has been hypothesized as a potential trigger for the PETM through the release of large quantities of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The emplacement of these large igneous provinces (LIPs) likely influenced regional and global climates, ocean chemistry, and biogeochemical cycles.

In Northwest Europe, the sedimentary sequences from this period provide evidence of varying environmental conditions leading up to the PETM. Marine sediments from the North Sea Basin and the Atlantic Margin reveal changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and marine biota. These records are complemented by terrestrial deposits from the London-Paris Basin and other continental sites, which document shifts in vegetation, hydrology, and terrestrial fauna.

#### Marine Environmental Changes

Marine sediments in Northwest Europe from the late Paleocene show significant variability in deposition patterns, indicative of changing sea levels and oceanic conditions. For instance, the North Sea Basin experienced transgressive-regressive cycles, reflecting global sea-level fluctuations influenced by polar ice volume and thermal expansion of seawater. These cycles affected sedimentation rates, water depth, and the distribution of marine habitats.

Paleontological data from marine cores reveal shifts in microfossil assemblages, particularly foraminifera and nannoplankton, which are sensitive indicators of ocean temperature and chemistry. Prior to the PETM, these assemblages show signs of stress, such as changes in species composition and abundance, suggesting that marine ecosystems were already experiencing environmental pressures. Geochemical analyses, including stable isotope and trace element studies, provide further evidence of changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and carbon cycling.

#### Terrestrial Environmental Changes

The terrestrial realm of Northwest Europe also underwent significant changes during the late Paleocene. Fossil evidence from the London-Paris Basin and other continental sites indicates shifts in vegetation patterns, with a trend towards more thermophilic (warm-adapted) plant species. This shift is interpreted as a response to gradually warming temperatures leading up to the PETM.

Palynological (pollen and spore) records from these sites show changes in plant community composition and diversity, reflecting alterations in climate and possibly atmospheric CO2 levels. Additionally, sedimentological evidence suggests changes in hydrology, such as increased weathering rates and river discharge, which could be linked to more intense rainfall and seasonality.

Vertebrate fossils from terrestrial deposits provide insights into the faunal responses to these environmental changes. Changes in mammalian diversity and distribution, particularly the appearance and expansion of new groups such as early primates and artiodactyls, suggest that terrestrial ecosystems were undergoing significant reorganization prior to the PETM.

#### Interplay of Factors Leading to the PETM

The pre-PETM environmental changes in Northwest Europe likely involved a complex interplay of volcanic activity, oceanographic changes, and terrestrial ecosystem dynamics. The volcanic activity associated with the NAIP would have released significant amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to gradual warming. This warming, in turn, could have triggered feedback mechanisms, such as the destabilization of methane hydrates in marine sediments, leading to further carbon release and climatic warming.

Changes in ocean circulation, possibly driven by tectonic shifts and altered temperature gradients, would have influenced marine nutrient distribution and productivity, impacting marine biota. On land, the warming climate and changes in precipitation patterns would have affected vegetation and soil processes, influencing carbon cycling and storage.

#### Objectives and Methodology

This study aims to reconstruct the environmental conditions in Northwest Europe leading up to the PETM by integrating multidisciplinary data from marine and terrestrial records. Our specific objectives are to:

1. Characterize the pre-PETM marine environmental changes using sedimentological, paleontological, and geochemical data from the North Sea Basin and Atlantic Margin.
2. Investigate the terrestrial environmental changes through palynological, paleobotanical, and vertebrate fossil records from the London-Paris Basin and other continental sites.
3. Assess the potential drivers of these changes, including volcanic activity, ocean circulation shifts, and climate feedback mechanisms.

To achieve these objectives, we employ a range of analytical techniques, including:

- Sediment core analysis to examine depositional environments and sedimentary structures.
- Foraminiferal and nannoplankton assemblage studies to infer past oceanographic conditions.
- Stable isotope and trace element geochemistry to reconstruct past temperatures, salinity, and carbon cycling.
- Palynological analysis to track changes in terrestrial vegetation and climate.
- Vertebrate paleontology to document faunal responses and ecological shifts.

#### Significance and Implications

Understanding the environmental changes in Northwest Europe preceding the PETM is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it provides insights into the regional manifestations of global climatic events, highlighting the interplay between local and global factors. Secondly, it sheds light on the mechanisms and feedbacks involved in rapid climate change, offering valuable analogs for current and future climatic shifts. Finally, it contributes to our broader understanding of the PETM, a key interval in Earth's history that offers lessons for the ongoing Anthropocene epoch.

In conclusion, this study aims to unravel the complex environmental dynamics in Northwest Europe before the PETM, enhancing our understanding of the processes that drive rapid climate change. By integrating marine and terrestrial records, we provide a comprehensive picture of the prelude to one of the most significant climatic events in Earth's history, with implications for both past and present climate science.
