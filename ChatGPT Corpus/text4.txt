This paper presents new Amos-type bounds for ratios of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. By leveraging asymptotic expansions and properties of Bessel functions, we derive bounds that generalize and improve upon existing results in the literature. These bounds have significant implications for numerical analysis and applied mathematics, particularly in the fields of probability, statistics, and mathematical physics, where Bessel functions frequently arise. The improved accuracy and tighter constraints provided by these new bounds facilitate more precise computations and theoretical developments involving Bessel functions.

### Introduction

Modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds, denoted as \( I_\nu(z) \) and \( K_\nu(z) \) respectively, play a pivotal role in various branches of applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. They arise naturally in problems involving cylindrical symmetry, heat conduction, and wave propagation, among others. Given their widespread application, precise knowledge of their properties and behaviors is essential.

A particularly important aspect of Bessel functions is the behavior of their ratios. These ratios appear in numerous applications, including solutions to differential equations, asymptotic analyses, and numerical approximations. Understanding the bounds of these ratios is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms and for providing insights into the qualitative behavior of solutions involving Bessel functions.

One of the foundational works in this area is by Amos, who established significant bounds for Bessel function ratios. These Amos-type bounds have been instrumental in various applications, yet there is a continuous need to refine and extend these results to cover broader scenarios and to achieve tighter bounds. This paper aims to address this need by developing new Amos-type bounds for ratios of modified Bessel functions, enhancing their applicability and precision.

#### Background and Motivation

Modified Bessel functions are solutions to the modified Bessel differential equation:

\[ z^2 \frac{d^2 w}{dz^2} + z \frac{dw}{dz} - (z^2 + \nu^2)w = 0. \]

The functions \( I_\nu(z) \) and \( K_\nu(z) \) can be defined by their series expansions and integral representations. For real or complex order \(\nu\) and argument \(z\), these functions exhibit intricate behaviors, especially for large arguments or orders, necessitating careful analysis of their ratios.

The classical Amos bounds provide asymptotic estimates for the ratios of modified Bessel functions, particularly useful in contexts where \( \nu \) or \( z \) is large. However, practical applications often require more refined bounds that hold across a wider range of parameters, thus motivating the need for generalized and improved estimates.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this paper are to:

1. Derive new bounds for the ratios \( \frac{I_{\nu+1}(z)}{I_\nu(z)} \) and \( \frac{K_{\nu+1}(z)}{K_\nu(z)} \) that extend and improve upon existing Amos-type results.
2. Validate these bounds through rigorous mathematical analysis and comparison with known results.
3. Discuss the implications of these new bounds for numerical analysis, including stability and accuracy in computational applications.

To achieve these objectives, we will explore the asymptotic behavior of modified Bessel functions and leverage advanced mathematical techniques to derive the desired bounds. We will also provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical utility of our results.

#### Mathematical Preliminaries

Before delving into the derivation of new bounds, it is essential to review some fundamental properties of modified Bessel functions. The modified Bessel functions of the first kind \( I_\nu(z) \) and the second kind \( K_\nu(z) \) are defined as follows:

\[ I_\nu(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k! \Gamma(k + \nu + 1)} \left( \frac{z}{2} \right)^{2k+\nu}, \]

\[ K_\nu(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{I_{-\nu}(z) - I_\nu(z)}{\sin(\nu \pi)}, \]

for non-integer \(\nu\). For integer \(\nu\), the definition of \( K_\nu(z) \) involves a limiting process due to the singularity in the denominator.

Key properties that will be utilized in our analysis include the recurrence relations:

\[ I_{\nu-1}(z) + I_{\nu+1}(z) = \frac{2\nu}{z} I_\nu(z), \]

\[ K_{\nu-1}(z) - K_{\nu+1}(z) = \frac{2\nu}{z} K_\nu(z), \]

and the asymptotic expansions for large \(z\):

\[ I_\nu(z) \sim \frac{e^z}{\sqrt{2\pi z}} \left( 1 - \frac{4\nu^2 - 1}{8z} + \frac{(4\nu^2 - 1)(4\nu^2 - 9)}{2!(8z)^2} + \cdots \right), \]

\[ K_\nu(z) \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2z}} e^{-z} \left( 1 + \frac{4\nu^2 - 1}{8z} + \frac{(4\nu^2 - 1)(4\nu^2 - 9)}{2!(8z)^2} + \cdots \right). \]

These expressions provide the foundation for deriving new bounds by analyzing the leading-order terms and corrections in the asymptotic expansions.

#### Derivation of New Bounds

To derive new Amos-type bounds for the ratios \( \frac{I_{\nu+1}(z)}{I_\nu(z)} \) and \( \frac{K_{\nu+1}(z)}{K_\nu(z)} \), we will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Asymptotic Analysis**: We begin by examining the asymptotic expansions of \( I_\nu(z) \) and \( K_\nu(z) \) for large \(z\). By isolating the dominant terms, we can derive initial estimates for the ratios.
2. **Refinement through Recurrence Relations**: Utilizing the recurrence relations for modified Bessel functions, we refine the initial estimates, accounting for higher-order corrections.
3. **Validation against Known Results**: We compare the derived bounds with classical Amos bounds and other known results to validate their accuracy and generality.
4. **Numerical Verification**: Through computational experiments, we verify the practical applicability of the new bounds across a range of parameters.

#### Implications and Applications

The improved bounds for modified Bessel function ratios have several significant implications:

- **Numerical Analysis**: More accurate bounds enhance the stability and precision of numerical algorithms involving Bessel functions, such as those used in solving differential equations and integral transforms.
- **Probability and Statistics**: Bessel functions appear in various statistical distributions and stochastic processes. Tighter bounds facilitate more precise estimations and inferences in these contexts.
- **Mathematical Physics**: In problems involving wave propagation, heat conduction, and quantum mechanics, improved bounds provide better approximations and insights into the underlying physical phenomena.

In conclusion, this paper presents new Amos-type bounds for modified Bessel function ratios, offering substantial improvements over existing results. By leveraging asymptotic analysis and recurrence relations, we derive bounds that are both accurate and broadly applicable. These findings have important implications for numerical analysis, probability, statistics, and mathematical physics, underscoring the critical role of Bessel functions in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
