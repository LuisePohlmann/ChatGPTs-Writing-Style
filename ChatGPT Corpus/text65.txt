### Abstract

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) was utilized to study the binding interactions of para-hydrogen (p-H2) within an ultra-microporous metal-organic framework (MOF). The MOF selected for this investigation is characterized by its exceptionally small pore size and high surface area, making it an ideal candidate for hydrogen storage applications. INS experiments revealed distinct energy transfer processes associated with the rotational and vibrational modes of p-H2 adsorbed within the MOF. These findings provide insight into the nature of hydrogen adsorption sites and the strength of the interaction between p-H2 molecules and the framework. The study demonstrates that ultra-microporous MOFs can significantly influence the rotational dynamics of hydrogen, which is crucial for enhancing hydrogen storage efficiency. These results contribute to the understanding of gas adsorption mechanisms in MOFs and support the development of advanced materials for energy storage applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

The increasing global demand for clean and sustainable energy sources has driven extensive research into hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier. Hydrogen storage remains a critical challenge, particularly the development of materials that can store hydrogen efficiently at ambient conditions. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their high surface area, tunable pore sizes, and chemical versatility. Among the various types of MOFs, ultra-microporous MOFs, with pore sizes less than 0.7 nm, are of particular interest because they can potentially offer high hydrogen uptake capacities.

Para-hydrogen (p-H2), the ortho isomer of molecular hydrogen with antiparallel nuclear spins, is of special interest in hydrogen storage studies due to its lower energy state and its interaction with adsorbent materials. The binding interactions of p-H2 within MOFs can significantly affect the storage capacity and release kinetics, making it essential to understand these interactions at a molecular level.
