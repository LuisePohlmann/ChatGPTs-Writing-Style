### Abstract

The scalable expansion of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is critical for their use in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery. This study investigates the growth and maintenance of hiPSCs in a defined, xeno-free E8 medium under both adherent and suspension culture conditions. We demonstrate that hiPSCs can be effectively expanded while maintaining pluripotency and genomic stability. Under suspension conditions, hiPSCs formed uniform spheroids, exhibiting robust growth characteristics. Our findings indicate that the E8 medium supports scalable hiPSC culture, providing a reliable and reproducible platform for large-scale stem cell production.

### Introduction

#### Background

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine and biomedical research since their discovery by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006. These cells, reprogrammed from somatic cells, possess the ability to differentiate into any cell type, offering immense potential for developing personalized therapies, disease models, and drug screening platforms. However, the clinical and industrial applications of hiPSCs require robust methods for their large-scale production while maintaining their pluripotent characteristics and genetic integrity.

#### Problem Statement

A significant challenge in hiPSC research is developing scalable and reproducible culture systems that are free from animal-derived components, which can introduce variability and potential contaminants. Traditional culture methods often rely on feeder cells and serum, which are unsuitable for clinical-grade applications due to the risk of zoonotic infections and batch-to-batch variability. The development of defined, xeno-free culture systems is therefore essential for the clinical translation of hiPSC technologies.

In this context, the E8 medium, a defined and xeno-free formulation developed by the Thomson lab, represents a significant advancement. It eliminates the need for serum and feeder layers, providing a more controlled environment for hiPSC culture. However, while E8 medium has shown promise for adherent hiPSC cultures, its efficacy in supporting hiPSC expansion under suspension conditions, which is more suitable for large-scale bioprocessing, remains underexplored.

#### Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Evaluate the growth and maintenance of hiPSCs in the E8 medium under adherent and suspension culture conditions.**
2. **Assess the pluripotency and genomic stability of hiPSCs cultured in E8 medium.**
3. **Compare the scalability and practicality of adherent versus suspension culture systems for hiPSC expansion.**

#### Literature Review

Previous studies have established various culture systems for hiPSCs, highlighting the need for xeno-free and defined media to ensure consistency and safety for clinical applications. The E8 medium has emerged as a robust alternative to traditional media, supporting the self-renewal and pluripotency of hiPSCs without the use of feeder cells or serum.

Studies by Chen et al. (2011) and Beers et al. (2012) demonstrated that hiPSCs could be maintained in the E8 medium with minimal differentiation and stable growth rates. However, these studies primarily focused on adherent cultures. Suspension culture systems, which facilitate larger-scale production by enabling the growth of cell aggregates or spheroids in bioreactors, have been less extensively studied in the context of the E8 medium.

Recent advancements in bioprocessing technologies have shown that suspension cultures can enhance the scalability of stem cell production. For example, Kropp et al. (2017) demonstrated that hiPSCs could be expanded in suspension using microcarrier-based systems. However, the use of microcarriers introduces additional complexity and cost. Therefore, there is a need to explore simpler suspension culture methods, such as spheroid formation, in the defined E8 medium.

#### Methodology

**Cell Culture and Maintenance**

hiPSC lines were cultured in the E8 medium under both adherent and suspension conditions. Adherent cultures were maintained on vitronectin-coated plates, while suspension cultures were initiated by transferring single-cell suspensions into non-adhesive culture vessels, allowing the formation of spheroids.

**Growth Assessment**

Cell growth was monitored by measuring cell density, viability, and proliferation rates. In adherent cultures, cell density was assessed using automated cell counters, while spheroid size and number were measured using microscopy and image analysis software in suspension cultures.

**Pluripotency and Genomic Stability**

Pluripotency was assessed by immunostaining for key pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG) and by quantitative PCR analysis of pluripotency gene expression. Genomic stability was evaluated using karyotyping and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect any chromosomal abnormalities.

**Scalability Assessment**

The scalability of the culture systems was evaluated by assessing cell yield and viability over extended culture periods. Additionally, the practicality of scaling up the cultures was examined by transitioning from small-scale culture vessels to larger bioreactors for suspension cultures.

#### Results

**Adherent Culture**

hiPSCs maintained in adherent cultures with E8 medium showed robust growth and high viability, with a doubling time consistent with previous reports. Immunostaining and qPCR confirmed the expression of pluripotency markers, and karyotyping revealed no chromosomal abnormalities after extended culture.

**Suspension Culture**

In suspension cultures, hiPSCs formed uniform spheroids with a consistent size distribution. These spheroids exhibited high viability and maintained their pluripotency, as evidenced by marker expression and gene analysis. The suspension cultures showed comparable growth rates to adherent cultures, indicating the feasibility of this method for large-scale expansion.

**Scalability**

Transitioning to larger bioreactors, the suspension cultures maintained stable growth and high cell yield, demonstrating the practicality of scaling up hiPSC production in the E8 medium. The absence of microcarriers simplified the culture process and reduced costs, making this approach attractive for industrial applications.

#### Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate that the E8 medium effectively supports the growth and maintenance of hiPSCs under both adherent and suspension culture conditions. The ability to expand hiPSCs in suspension as spheroids offers a scalable and cost-effective method for large-scale production, which is critical for clinical and industrial applications.

The maintenance of pluripotency and genomic stability in both culture systems underscores the suitability of the E8 medium for hiPSC expansion. The scalability of the suspension culture system, facilitated by the formation of uniform spheroids, highlights its potential for bioprocessing applications.

#### Conclusion

This study establishes the defined xeno-free E8 medium as a robust platform for the scalable expansion of hiPSCs under both adherent and suspension culture conditions. The ability to maintain pluripotency and genomic stability in suspension cultures, coupled with the practical advantages of this system, positions it as a valuable tool for advancing hiPSC research and applications. Future work will focus on optimizing bioreactor conditions and further scaling up the suspension culture system to meet the demands of clinical and industrial-scale hiPSC production.
