### Abstract

The flight dynamics of plate-type windborne debris are critical for understanding the transport and impact behavior of debris in various environmental scenarios, including during severe weather events. This study presents Part II of an investigation into plate-type windborne debris flight using coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) models. Building on initial findings, this part focuses on both free and constrained flight scenarios to provide a comprehensive analysis of how debris interacts with wind forces under different conditions. We employ a coupled CFD-RBD approach to simulate the aerodynamics and motion of plate-type debris, examining the effects of aerodynamic forces, debris orientation, and environmental constraints on flight trajectories. The results reveal significant insights into the flight behavior of debris, including patterns of stability, potential for tumbling, and the influence of constraints such as obstacles or boundaries. These findings have implications for debris management, risk assessment, and safety measures in environments prone to windborne debris.

### Introduction

#### Background

The study of windborne debris is essential for understanding its behavior and potential impact during severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and high-wind scenarios. Plate-type debris, which includes various flat and rigid objects like roofing materials, signs, and panels, represents a significant concern due to its potential to cause damage and pose safety risks. The flight dynamics of such debris are influenced by aerodynamic forces, the debris' physical properties, and environmental constraints.

To accurately model and predict the behavior of windborne debris, it is crucial to understand both its free flight dynamics and how it interacts with environmental constraints. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) are powerful tools for simulating these interactions. While CFD provides detailed insights into the aerodynamic forces acting on the debris, RBD allows for the simulation of the debris' motion and trajectory. Coupling these models offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing debris flight.
