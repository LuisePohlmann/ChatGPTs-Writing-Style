### Abstract

This study investigates the mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of epoxy polymers modified with polysiloxane-based core-shell particles. Epoxy resins are widely used in various industrial applications due to their excellent mechanical properties, but they often suffer from brittleness that limits their practical use. To address this limitation, polysiloxane-based core-shell particles have been introduced as toughening agents to enhance the mechanical performance of epoxy polymers. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a series of epoxy composites incorporating varying concentrations of polysiloxane-based core-shell particles. Using a combination of mechanical testing (tensile, impact, and fracture toughness tests), morphological analysis (scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy), and theoretical modeling, we evaluated the effects of these particles on the mechanical properties of the epoxy matrix. Our findings reveal significant improvements in impact resistance, fracture toughness, and overall mechanical performance of the epoxy composites compared to unmodified epoxy. The toughening mechanisms, including particle-induced crack bridging, stress concentration relief, and energy dissipation, were investigated to understand the underlying processes contributing to the enhanced toughness. This study provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance epoxy composites with improved toughness and has implications for their use in demanding structural and engineering applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Epoxy polymers are integral to a wide range of industrial applications, including aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering, due to their superior mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength, chemical resistance, and thermal stability. However, a notable limitation of traditional epoxy resins is their inherent brittleness, which can lead to premature failure under impact or stress. This brittleness is primarily due to the high cross-link density of epoxy networks, which, while contributing to their rigidity, also reduces their ability to deform plastically and absorb impact energy.

To enhance the toughness of epoxy polymers, researchers have explored various modification strategies, including the incorporation of toughening agents. Among these, core-shell particles have emerged as an effective means to improve the mechanical properties of epoxy resins. Core-shell particles consist of a core material encapsulated by a shell material, combining the desirable properties of both components. Polysiloxane-based core-shell particles, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their unique combination of flexibility, low surface energy, and compatibility with epoxy matrices.

#### Motivation

The motivation for this study stems from the need to overcome the brittleness of epoxy polymers while preserving their advantageous properties. Polysiloxane-based core-shell particles offer a promising solution by introducing toughening mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of stresses and improve the overall durability of epoxy composites. Understanding how these particles influence the mechanical properties and toughening mechanisms of epoxy resins is crucial for developing advanced materials with enhanced performance.

Several factors drive the interest in polysiloxane-based core-shell particles for epoxy modification:

1. **Enhanced Toughness**: By incorporating core-shell particles, it is possible to enhance the toughness of epoxy polymers, making them suitable for applications requiring high impact resistance and durability.
2. **Mechanical Performance**: Core-shell particles can modify the stress distribution within the epoxy matrix, leading to improved mechanical performance and reduced brittleness.
