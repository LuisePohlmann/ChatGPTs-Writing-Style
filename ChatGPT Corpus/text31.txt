### Introduction

#### Background

Magnesium nitride fluorides, particularly MgNF₃ and Mg₃NF₄, represent an intriguing class of materials with potential applications in advanced materials science and catalysis. These compounds combine elements with varied electronic properties, leading to unique structural and bonding characteristics. Understanding their crystal structures is crucial for optimizing their performance in practical applications, such as catalysis, battery technology, and as components in advanced materials.

Powder neutron diffraction is a powerful technique for studying the structural properties of crystalline materials, particularly those containing light elements such as nitrogen and fluorine. Unlike X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction provides complementary information by being highly sensitive to lighter elements and offering insight into atomic positions and thermal vibrations with high precision. This makes it particularly suited for detailed structural studies of magnesium nitride fluorides.
