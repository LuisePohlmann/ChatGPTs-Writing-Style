### Introduction

#### Background

Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are increasingly recognized for their suitability in various wind energy applications, including urban and offshore environments. Unlike Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs), VAWTs capture wind from any direction and can operate in turbulent conditions, making them a flexible option for diverse wind regimes. However, the integration and optimization of multiple VAWTs in a farm setup present challenges related to both aerodynamic performance and electrical management.

A VAWT farm consists of multiple turbines arranged to maximize wind capture and energy production. Efficient management of power generation and distribution in such farms requires advanced control systems that address both aerodynamic interactions among turbines and electrical power handling. Passive rectifiers and a mutual DC-bus are promising technologies for enhancing electrical performance in VAWT farms. Passive rectifiers simplify the conversion of generated AC power to DC power, while a mutual DC-bus facilitates efficient power distribution among turbines.
