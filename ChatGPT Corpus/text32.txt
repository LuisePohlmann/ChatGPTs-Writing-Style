### Abstract

In this paper, we explore the concept of cores of nonnegative matrices, focusing on the structural and theoretical implications of two-core matrices. A nonnegative matrix is a matrix in which all elements are nonnegative real numbers. The core of a matrix is an abstract notion that represents a significant part of the matrix's structure, especially in the context of matrix decomposition and optimization problems. We introduce the notion of a two-core matrix, which is a nonnegative matrix possessing exactly two distinct cores. We provide a detailed analysis of the conditions under which a nonnegative matrix can exhibit this property and investigate the mathematical implications for matrix theory. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural properties of nonnegative matrices and offer insights into their applications in various fields, including optimization and combinatorics.

### Introduction

#### Background

Nonnegative matrices are matrices where all entries are nonnegative real numbers. These matrices are prevalent in various fields, including optimization, economics, and network analysis, due to their ability to model systems where negative values are not feasible. A core concept in matrix theory is that of the core of a matrix, which generally refers to a central or fundamental part of the matrix's structure. Understanding the core of a matrix can provide insights into its properties and facilitate various applications, such as matrix decomposition, spectral theory, and combinatorial optimization.

#### Motivation

The study of cores in nonnegative matrices has been well established, with significant research focusing on properties like nonnegative matrix factorizations and matrix decompositions. However, the concept of having multiple cores within a nonnegative matrix is relatively underexplored. Specifically, the idea of a two-core matrix—one that possesses exactly two distinct cores—opens new avenues for understanding the structural complexity of nonnegative matrices.

Exploring matrices with two distinct cores has several motivations:

1. **Complexity and Structure**: Identifying and analyzing matrices with multiple cores helps in understanding their structural complexity and the nature of their decompositions.
2. **Optimization Applications**: Nonnegative matrices are frequently used in optimization problems. Understanding their core structure could lead to new optimization techniques or improvements in existing methods.
3. **Combinatorial Insights**: Matrices with multiple cores may exhibit unique combinatorial properties that are not apparent in matrices with a single core. Studying these properties could lead to new results in combinatorial optimization and related areas.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. **Define Two-Core Matrices**: Introduce and define the concept of a two-core matrix, providing a formal definition and characterization.
2. **Analyze Conditions**: Investigate the conditions under which a nonnegative matrix exhibits exactly two distinct cores, including necessary and sufficient conditions.
3. **Explore Implications**: Discuss the implications of having two distinct cores for matrix properties, optimization problems, and potential applications.

The scope of this study includes theoretical analysis and characterization of two-core matrices, as well as exploration of their mathematical and practical implications.

#### Methodology

1. **Definition and Characterization**: Provide a rigorous definition of two-core matrices and develop criteria for identifying such matrices. This involves analyzing the structural properties of nonnegative matrices and their cores.
2. **Theoretical Analysis**: Conduct a theoretical investigation into the conditions required for a nonnegative matrix to have exactly two distinct cores. This includes proving necessary and sufficient conditions and exploring the implications of these conditions.
3. **Examples and Applications**: Provide examples of two-core matrices and discuss their relevance in practical applications, such as optimization and combinatorial problems. Explore how these matrices can be used in specific contexts and their potential benefits.

#### Literature Review

The concept of matrix cores and their significance has been studied in various contexts. Nonnegative matrices, in particular, have been extensively researched due to their applications in optimization and combinatorial problems. Key studies related to cores of matrices include:

- **Gershgorin's Theorem (1931)**: Provided early insights into matrix spectra, influencing subsequent research on matrix structure and properties.

- **Horn and Johnson (2013)**: Provided comprehensive coverage of matrix theory, including discussions on matrix decompositions and spectral properties relevant to understanding cores.

Recent research has also explored specific properties of nonnegative matrices, such as their factorizations and decompositions. However, the concept of two cores in nonnegative matrices has not been extensively studied, highlighting a gap in the literature that this paper aims to address.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

Consider a nonnegative matrix used in a network optimization problem. If this matrix exhibits exactly two distinct cores, understanding these cores could reveal insights into the network's structure and optimize its design. For example, a matrix representing network flows might have two distinct cores corresponding to different subnetworks or flow patterns, influencing optimization strategies.

Another example involves nonnegative matrices in data analysis, where the presence of two distinct cores could indicate underlying patterns or clusters within the data. Analyzing these cores could lead to improved data classification or clustering algorithms.

#### Conclusion

This paper introduces and characterizes the concept of two-core matrices within the framework of nonnegative matrices. The findings provide valuable insights into the structural properties of these matrices and their implications for various applications. By defining and analyzing two-core matrices, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of nonnegative matrices and offer new perspectives for optimization and combinatorial problems.
