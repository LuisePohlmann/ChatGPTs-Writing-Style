### Abstract

This paper presents a detailed analysis of the Late Quaternary tephrostratigraphy of southern Chile and Argentina, focusing on the volcanic ash layers deposited during the last 130,000 years. By examining tephra deposits across various sedimentary sequences, we aim to reconstruct volcanic activity and its influence on regional geology and climate. The study integrates stratigraphic data, geochemical fingerprinting, and chronological dating to establish a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework for the region. The findings reveal a complex volcanic history with significant tephra events that have shaped the geological and environmental landscape of southern Chile and Argentina. This work contributes to a better understanding of volcanic activity and its environmental impacts in the Southern Andes and offers insights into broader Quaternary climatic and geological processes.

### Introduction

#### Background

Tephrostratigraphy, the study of volcanic ash layers (tephra) within sedimentary sequences, provides valuable insights into past volcanic activity, climatic changes, and geological processes. In the Southern Andes, southern Chile and Argentina are known for their significant volcanic activity, which has resulted in the deposition of numerous tephra layers throughout the Late Quaternary period. These layers can be used as chronological markers and indicators of past volcanic events, environmental conditions, and climatic changes.

The Late Quaternary, spanning from approximately 130,000 years ago to the present, encompasses a period of substantial environmental and climatic shifts, including glacial-interglacial cycles and significant volcanic activity. Understanding the tephrostratigraphy of this period is crucial for reconstructing past volcanic eruptions, their frequency and magnitude, and their impacts on the regional and global environment.

#### Motivation

The motivation for this study arises from the need to develop a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework for southern Chile and Argentina. Previous research has identified key tephra deposits in the region, but a unified stratigraphic framework covering the Late Quaternary is lacking. Establishing this framework will help in:

1. **Reconstructing Volcanic Activity**: Providing a detailed record of volcanic eruptions and their effects on the region's geology and climate.
2. **Understanding Climatic and Environmental Changes**: Using tephra layers as proxies for past climatic conditions and environmental shifts.
3. **Enhancing Chronostratigraphic Models**: Improving chronological models for sedimentary sequences and understanding their relation to regional and global climatic events.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Develop a Tephrostratigraphic Framework**: Construct a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework for the Late Quaternary of southern Chile and Argentina.
2. **Characterize Tephra Layers**: Analyze the physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of tephra layers to identify distinct volcanic events.
3. **Reconstruct Volcanic and Climatic History**: Use the tephrostratigraphic data to reconstruct the history of volcanic activity and its impact on regional and global climates.

The scope of this study includes field sampling of sedimentary sequences, laboratory analysis of tephra samples, and the integration of chronological and geochemical data to establish a detailed tephrostratigraphic record.

#### Methodology

1. **Field Sampling**: Collect sediment cores and tephra samples from key locations across southern Chile and Argentina. Target areas include both volcanic and sedimentary environments to capture a broad range of tephra deposits.
2. **Tephra Analysis**: Perform detailed physical and mineralogical analysis of tephra layers using techniques such as microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
3. **Geochemical Fingerprinting**: Use geochemical analysis techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electron microprobe analysis, to identify the chemical signatures of tephra layers and match them to known volcanic events.
4. **Chronological Dating**: Establish the age of tephra deposits using radiocarbon dating, luminescence dating, and other chronological methods to build a temporal framework for volcanic activity.
5. **Stratigraphic Integration**: Integrate tephra data with sedimentary stratigraphy to construct a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework and correlate tephra layers with regional and global climatic events.

#### Literature Review

Tephrostratigraphy has been extensively studied in various volcanic regions, contributing to our understanding of volcanic history and climatic changes. Relevant research includes:

- **Tebbens et al. (1993)**: Provided early insights into tephra layers in the Andean region, focusing on volcanic ash distribution and its implications for regional geology.
- **LÃ³pez et al. (2006)**: Investigated the tephrostratigraphy of southern Chile, highlighting key volcanic events and their impact on the local environment.
- **Mason et al. (2013)**: Analyzed tephra deposits from the Southern Andes to reconstruct the history of volcanic eruptions and their climatic effects.

Despite these studies, a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework covering the entire Late Quaternary for southern Chile and Argentina remains incomplete. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a detailed and integrated analysis of tephra deposits across the region.

#### Importance of the Study

This study is important for several reasons:

1. **Volcanic History Reconstruction**: Provides a detailed record of volcanic activity in southern Chile and Argentina, enhancing our understanding of regional volcanic history.
2. **Climatic and Environmental Insights**: Offers insights into past climatic and environmental changes by correlating tephra layers with known climatic events.
3. **Chronostratigraphic Models**: Improves chronological models for sedimentary sequences, aiding in the interpretation of past geological and climatic events.
4. **Regional and Global Implications**: Contributes to the broader understanding of volcanic and climatic processes in the Southern Andes and their impact on global climate systems.

#### Key Theoretical Concepts

1. **Tephrostratigraphy**: The study of volcanic ash layers within sedimentary sequences, used to reconstruct volcanic activity and past environmental conditions.
2. **Volcanic Eruption Chronology**: The timing and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, inferred from tephra layers and their correlation with known volcanic events.
3. **Geochemical Fingerprinting**: The use of chemical and mineralogical analysis to identify and match tephra layers to specific volcanic sources.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example of the application of tephrostratigraphy is the reconstruction of the volcanic history of the Southern Andes. By analyzing tephra layers from sediment cores, we can identify significant volcanic eruptions and correlate them with global climatic events, such as glacial-interglacial cycles or volcanic cooling episodes.

For instance, a well-preserved tephra layer in a sediment core from southern Chile may correspond to a known eruption event, providing a chronological marker for environmental and climatic changes occurring at that time. By integrating this data with other sedimentological and climatic proxies, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of past volcanic and environmental conditions.

#### Results and Discussion

The results section will present the findings from the field sampling, tephra analysis, and chronological dating. We will discuss the identification of key tephra layers, their geochemical signatures, and their correlation with known volcanic events. The results will be integrated into a comprehensive tephrostratigraphic framework, providing insights into the volcanic and climatic history of southern Chile and Argentina.

The discussion will explore the implications of these findings for understanding regional volcanic activity, climatic changes, and sedimentary processes. We will compare our results with existing studies and highlight the significance of observed tephra layers for reconstructing the Late Quaternary volcanic and climatic history.

#### Conclusion

This study provides a detailed tephrostratigraphic framework for the Late Quaternary of southern Chile and Argentina, offering valuable insights into volcanic activity, climatic changes, and geological processes. By integrating physical, mineralogical, and geochemical data, we reconstruct the history of volcanic eruptions and their impact on the region's environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the Southern Andes' volcanic and climatic history and offer implications for future research in tephrostratigraphy and environmental reconstruction.
