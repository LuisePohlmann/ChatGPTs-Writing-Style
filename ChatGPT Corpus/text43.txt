### Abstract

This study details the development of a pearl millet genepool with enhanced resistance to Striga, a parasitic weed that severely impacts pearl millet production in West Africa. Through five cycles of recurrent selection under Striga-infested field conditions, we aimed to identify and cultivate pearl millet varieties with improved resistance traits. The research involved evaluating a diverse set of pearl millet accessions for their response to Striga infestation, followed by selective breeding to enhance resistance. Key metrics, including Striga infection severity, plant growth parameters, and yield performance, were assessed across multiple cycles of selection. Our results demonstrated significant improvements in Striga resistance, with selected genotypes exhibiting reduced infection levels and better agronomic performance compared to the initial population. The development of this resistant genepool provides a valuable resource for enhancing pearl millet production in regions affected by Striga, contributing to food security and sustainable agriculture in West Africa. This paper presents the methodologies, results, and implications of our breeding program, offering insights into effective strategies for managing Striga through genetic improvement.

### Introduction

#### Background

Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is a crucial cereal crop in West Africa, known for its resilience in arid conditions and its importance as a staple food source. Despite its adaptability, pearl millet production is significantly constrained by the parasitic weed Striga, which attaches to the roots of the host plant, siphoning nutrients and water, and leading to severe yield losses. Striga spp. are notorious for their aggressive infestation and their ability to evade conventional control measures, making the development of resistant crop varieties essential for sustainable agricultural practices.

Striga infestation poses a major challenge to pearl millet farmers in West Africa, where the weed thrives in the region's agro-ecological conditions. Conventional control methods, including chemical herbicides and cultural practices, have limited success due to the persistent and adaptive nature of Striga. As a result, breeding for resistance has emerged as a critical strategy for managing this pest and improving pearl millet productivity.

#### Motivation

The motivation behind this study is rooted in the need to develop pearl millet varieties that can withstand Striga infestation, thereby improving crop yields and ensuring food security in West Africa. By utilizing recurrent selection techniques, we aim to enhance the genetic resistance of pearl millet to Striga through targeted breeding efforts. This approach allows for the continuous improvement of resistance traits over multiple generations, ultimately resulting in a genepool with robust resistance to Striga.

Several factors drive the significance of this research:

1. **Striga Impact**: Striga infestation leads to substantial yield losses in pearl millet, affecting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and threatening food security in the region.
2. **Genetic Improvement**: Breeding for resistance offers a sustainable solution to managing Striga, reducing the reliance on chemical controls and contributing to environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
3. **Regional Relevance**: Developing Striga-resistant pearl millet varieties is particularly important for West Africa, where the environmental conditions and agronomic practices are conducive to Striga proliferation.
