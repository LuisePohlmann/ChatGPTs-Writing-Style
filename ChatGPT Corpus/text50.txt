### Abstract

This study presents simulations of a vertical axis turbine (VAT) operating within a channel environment, focusing on its performance, flow dynamics, and efficiency. Vertical axis turbines, known for their ability to capture wind energy with a variety of flow angles, are increasingly being explored for applications in both wind and hydro energy systems. Understanding the behavior of these turbines in constrained environments such as channels is crucial for optimizing their design and operational parameters. In this research, we employ computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model the interactions between the turbine blades and the fluid flow within a channel, considering various parameters such as flow velocity, turbine geometry, and channel dimensions. Our simulations explore different operating conditions, including steady and unsteady flow scenarios, to assess the turbine's performance metrics such as power output, torque, and efficiency. The results reveal how channel constraints influence turbine performance, including effects on flow distribution and energy capture. This study provides insights into the practical considerations for deploying vertical axis turbines in channel environments and offers guidelines for optimizing turbine design for enhanced performance.

### Introduction

#### Background

The vertical axis turbine (VAT) is a type of wind or water turbine that generates energy through the rotation of blades around a vertical axis. Unlike horizontal axis turbines, VATs can capture energy from wind or water flows coming from various directions, making them particularly advantageous in environments with variable or turbulent flow conditions. Their compact design and ability to function effectively in constrained spaces, such as channels, make them suitable for various applications, including urban wind energy systems and hydroelectric power generation in narrow waterways.

Channels, which are confined flow environments often used in hydropower applications or as part of cooling systems, present unique challenges for turbine performance. The flow dynamics within a channel can be significantly different from those in open environments, with effects such as flow constriction, turbulence, and boundary layer interactions potentially influencing turbine efficiency. To optimize the design and placement of vertical axis turbines in these settings, it is essential to understand how these factors impact turbine performance.
