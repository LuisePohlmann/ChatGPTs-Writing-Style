### Introduction

#### Background

As the demand for renewable energy storage solutions increases, there is a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable battery technologies. Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) have dominated the market due to their high energy density and long cycle life. However, the limited availability and high cost of lithium resources have spurred research into alternative technologies, such as sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion), which utilize more abundant and less expensive sodium resources.

Na-ion batteries share similar working principles with Li-ion batteries but face unique challenges, including the need for suitable electrode materials that can operate efficiently within the electrochemical window of Na-ion chemistry. One of the critical challenges is finding positive electrode materials that can provide high energy and power densities while maintaining good cycling stability and rate capability.

#### Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the potential of NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 as a high energy and power positive electrode material for Na-ion batteries. Specifically, the study aims to:

1. **Synthesize NaFe0.5Co0.5O2**: Develop a reliable synthesis method for producing high-purity NaFe0.5Co0.5O2.
2. **Characterize Structural and Morphological Properties**: Use X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyze the structural and morphological properties of the synthesized material.
3. **Evaluate Electrochemical Performance**: Assess the electrochemical performance of NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

#### Literature Review

Previous studies have explored various transition metal oxides as positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. Materials such as NaFeO2, NaCoO2, and their derivatives have shown promise due to their layered structures, which facilitate Na+ intercalation and deintercalation. The substitution of transition metals in these oxides can significantly influence their electrochemical properties. For instance, partial substitution of Fe with Co in NaFeO2 has been reported to improve the material's electronic conductivity and structural stability, potentially enhancing its electrochemical performance.

NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 is a mixed transition metal oxide where Fe and Co are expected to contribute synergistically to the material's electrochemical properties. The incorporation of Co is anticipated to enhance the electronic conductivity and rate capability, while Fe provides a stable framework for Na+ intercalation. Despite these promising attributes, comprehensive studies on the electrochemical performance of NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 are limited, warranting a detailed investigation.

#### Synthesis and Characterization

**Synthesis Method**

NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 was synthesized via a conventional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, Fe2O3, and Co3O4 were thoroughly mixed and ground using a mortar and pestle. The mixture was calcined at 800°C for 12 hours in an air atmosphere to form the NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 phase. The resulting product was cooled to room temperature, reground, and subjected to a second calcination at 900°C for 6 hours to ensure phase purity and homogeneity.

**Structural Characterization**

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to determine the crystal structure and phase purity of the synthesized NaFe0.5Co0.5O2. The XRD patterns were recorded using a Cu Kα radiation source and analyzed using Rietveld refinement. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to examine the morphological characteristics and elemental composition of the material, respectively.

#### Electrochemical Testing

**Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)**

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the redox behavior and reversibility of the NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 electrode. The CV measurements were conducted using a three-electrode setup with Na metal as the reference and counter electrode. The potential range was set between 2.0 and 4.0 V vs. Na/Na+, and the scan rate was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mV/s.

**Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge Cycling**

The galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling tests were carried out to evaluate the capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability of the NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 electrode. The tests were performed in coin cells using Na metal as the anode and a 1 M NaPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte. The cells were cycled at various current densities ranging from 0.1 to 5 C to assess their performance under different rate conditions.

**Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analyze the charge transfer resistance and ionic conductivity of the NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 electrode. The EIS measurements were conducted in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The Nyquist plots obtained from the EIS data were fitted using an equivalent circuit model to extract the relevant electrochemical parameters.

#### Results and Discussion

The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of a single-phase NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 with a layered structure. The SEM images revealed uniform particle morphology with an average size of 1-2 µm, and the EDX spectra verified the homogenous distribution of Fe and Co within the material.

The CV curves showed well-defined redox peaks corresponding to the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Na+ ions, indicating good electrochemical reversibility. The galvanostatic charge-discharge tests demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 160 mAh/g and excellent cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles at 1 C. The rate capability tests revealed that the NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 electrode could deliver a high capacity even at a high current density of 5 C, underscoring its potential for high-power applications.

The EIS results indicated low charge transfer resistance and high ionic conductivity, further corroborating the material's suitability for Na-ion batteries. The combination of high capacity, good cycling stability, and excellent rate capability makes NaFe0.5Co0.5O2 a promising candidate for next-generation Na-ion batteries.
