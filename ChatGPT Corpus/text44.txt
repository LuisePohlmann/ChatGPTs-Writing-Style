### Abstract

This study explores a field-based approach for partitioning the sources of soil-respired CO2 using dual-chamber measurements of δ^13C. Soil respiration plays a critical role in the carbon cycle, and understanding the contributions of different carbon sources to soil CO2 emissions is essential for accurate carbon budgeting. We employed a three-end-member model to differentiate and quantify the contributions of plant root respiration, microbial decomposition, and soil organic carbon to total soil-respired CO2. By utilizing dual-chamber measurements, we were able to capture δ^13C values from different soil chambers under varying environmental conditions, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in resolving the relative contributions of each carbon source and highlight the variability in δ^13C signatures across different soil types and conditions. This method offers a robust tool for improving our understanding of soil carbon dynamics and can be applied to various ecosystems for more precise carbon cycle assessments.

### Introduction

#### Background

Soil respiration, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, involves the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) from soil into the atmosphere. This process is influenced by various factors, including plant root respiration, microbial decomposition of organic matter, and the breakdown of soil organic carbon (SOC). Understanding the relative contributions of these sources to total soil-respired CO2 is crucial for accurate carbon budgeting and for addressing the implications of soil carbon dynamics on climate change.

The δ^13C isotope signature of soil-respired CO2 can be used as a tracer to partition these sources. Carbon isotopic composition (δ^13C) varies among different carbon sources, providing a means to distinguish between contributions from root respiration, microbial activity, and SOC degradation. Accurate partitioning requires precise measurement techniques and robust analytical models to interpret the isotopic data.

#### Motivation

The motivation for this study is to enhance the accuracy of carbon source partitioning in soil-respired CO2 through a field-based approach. Previous methods have used single-chamber measurements or laboratory-based experiments, but these approaches often fall short in capturing the complexity of natural soil environments. By employing dual-chamber measurements and a three-end-member model, we aim to provide a more accurate and practical solution for partitioning soil-respired CO2.

Key reasons for this study include:

1. **Improved Carbon Budgeting**: Better understanding the contributions of different carbon sources to soil respiration can refine carbon budget estimates and improve climate models.
2. **Field-Based Approach**: Field-based measurements provide real-world data, capturing variability in environmental conditions and soil characteristics that laboratory experiments may miss.
3. **Enhanced Methodology**: Developing and validating robust methods for partitioning CO2 sources using δ^13C can advance our knowledge of soil carbon dynamics and improve management practices for carbon sequestration.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Develop a Field-Based Partitioning Method**: Utilize dual-chamber measurements and a three-end-member model to partition soil-respired CO2 into its primary sources—plant root respiration, microbial decomposition, and SOC.
2. **Assess δ^13C Variability**: Analyze δ^13C signatures from different soil chambers to evaluate the effectiveness of the partitioning method across various soil types and environmental conditions.
3. **Improve Carbon Cycle Understanding**: Provide insights into the relative contributions of different carbon sources to soil respiration and enhance the accuracy of soil carbon cycle assessments.

The scope of the study includes conducting field experiments, collecting and analyzing δ^13C data from soil-respired CO2, and applying the three-end-member model to interpret the results.

#### Methodology

1. **Dual-Chamber Measurements**: Implement a dual-chamber setup in field conditions to measure δ^13C values of soil-respired CO2. This involves placing chambers on the soil surface to capture CO2 emissions from different soil areas.
2. **Three-End-Member Model**: Apply a three-end-member model to partition the sources of soil-respired CO2 based on their δ^13C signatures. The model includes end-members representing plant root respiration, microbial decomposition, and SOC.

#### Literature Review

Previous research on soil-respired CO2 partitioning has employed various methods to understand carbon source contributions:
