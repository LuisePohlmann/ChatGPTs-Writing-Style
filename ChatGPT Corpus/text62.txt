### Abstract

Phosphorus (P) is a vital nutrient for plant growth, yet its availability in soils, particularly in the nutrient-poor Cape fynbos of South Africa, is often limited. This study investigates the use of rhizosphere acid and alkaline phosphatase activity as markers of P nutrition in nodulated Cyclopia and Aspalathus species, two genera endemic to the Cape fynbos. By analyzing phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere soils of these species, we aim to elucidate their P acquisition strategies and adaptability to low-P environments. Our findings indicate significant variations in phosphatase activities among different species and correlate these activities with soil P availability and plant P content. These insights contribute to understanding the ecological success of fynbos species in nutrient-poor soils and offer potential strategies for sustainable management of fynbos ecosystems.

### Introduction

#### Background

Phosphorus (P) is a critical macronutrient required for various physiological and biochemical processes in plants, including energy transfer, photosynthesis, and macromolecular biosynthesis. Despite its importance, P is often a limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in highly weathered and nutrient-poor soils such as those found in the Cape fynbos of South Africa. The Cape fynbos is a biodiversity hotspot characterized by a Mediterranean climate and acidic, sandy soils with low nutrient content, particularly phosphorus.

Plants in the fynbos have evolved unique adaptations to cope with these challenging conditions. Among these adaptations, the secretion of phosphatase enzymes in the rhizosphere plays a crucial role in enhancing P availability. Phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of organic P compounds, releasing inorganic phosphate that can be taken up by plants. There are two main types of phosphatases: acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphatases, which operate optimally at different pH levels.

Cyclopia and Aspalathus are two genera within the Fabaceae family, commonly found in the fynbos. These species form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enabling them to thrive in low-nitrogen environments. However, their strategies for acquiring phosphorus, particularly in P-deficient fynbos soils, are less understood. Studying the activity of acid and alkaline phosphatases in the rhizosphere of these plants can provide valuable insights into their P nutrition strategies and ecological success.

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. **Quantify Phosphatase Activity**: Measure the acid and alkaline phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere soils of nodulated Cyclopia and Aspalathus species.
2. **Correlate with P Nutrition**: Correlate phosphatase activities with soil P availability and plant P content to assess their role as markers of P nutrition.
3. **Compare Species and Sites**: Compare phosphatase activities across different species and locations within the Cape fynbos to identify variations in P acquisition strategies.
4. **Contribute to Ecosystem Management**: Provide insights that can inform sustainable management practices for conserving fynbos biodiversity.

#### Literature Review

Previous research highlights the importance of phosphatase activity in P acquisition:

- **Richardson et al. (2009)**: Reviewed the role of phosphatases in P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, emphasizing their importance in nutrient-poor soils.
