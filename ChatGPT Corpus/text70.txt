### Abstract

This paper presents an integral contravariant formulation of the fully non-linear Boussinesq equations, aimed at providing a more nuanced and efficient approach to modeling wave propagation and fluid dynamics in varying depths. The Boussinesq equations, widely used to describe long waves in shallow water, are reformulated using an integral contravariant framework that incorporates the effects of non-linearity and dispersion with greater precision. This formulation not only preserves the physical invariants of the system but also enhances computational efficiency and accuracy. The study demonstrates the application of this formulation through various test cases, including solitary waves and wave trains, comparing results with traditional approaches to validate its effectiveness. The new approach promises improvements in the simulation of complex wave phenomena and offers potential advancements in coastal engineering and fluid dynamics research.

### Introduction

#### Background

The Boussinesq equations are a set of partial differential equations derived to describe the behavior of long waves in shallow water. They account for both the non-linearity and dispersion of waves, making them essential tools for studying various oceanographic and hydraulic phenomena, including wave propagation, coastal erosion, and flood modeling. Despite their utility, traditional formulations of the Boussinesq equations often encounter challenges related to computational efficiency and the accurate representation of complex wave dynamics, particularly in scenarios involving significant non-linear effects and varying bathymetry.

The integral contravariant formulation is a mathematical approach that reformulates differential equations in a way that emphasizes the conservation of physical quantities and the geometric properties of the problem. This approach has been successfully applied to various fields, including general relativity and continuum mechanics. Applying this method to the Boussinesq equations offers the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, providing a more robust framework for analyzing wave dynamics in shallow water environments.
