### Introduction

#### Background

**Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSCs):** Human pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), possess the unique ability to differentiate into any cell type in the human body. This pluripotency makes them a powerful tool for studying developmental biology, modeling diseases, and developing regenerative therapies. A critical aspect of pluripotency and early differentiation is the role of key transcription factors such as SOX2.

**SOX2 and Its Role:** SOX2 is a transcription factor that plays a central role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in stem cells. It is also crucial for the development of the neuroectoderm, which gives rise to various neuronal and glial cell types. Given its importance, understanding the characteristics and behavior of SOX2-expressing cells derived from hPSCs is essential for advancing stem cell research and its applications.

#### Objectives

This study aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **To generate and characterize SOX2-expressing cell populations from hPSCs.** 
2. **To evaluate the stem cell properties of these cells, including their pluripotency and differentiation potential.**
3. **To assess the functional capabilities of SOX2-expressing cells, focusing on their ability to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages.**

#### Literature Review

**SOX2 in Stem Cell Biology**

SOX2 is one of the core transcription factors essential for maintaining pluripotency in stem cells. It works in conjunction with OCT4 and NANOG to regulate gene expression that supports self-renewal and pluripotency. The role of SOX2 extends beyond pluripotency; it is also involved in the early development of the central nervous system. Understanding the role of SOX2 in neuroectodermal differentiation can provide insights into the development of neuronal and glial cells from hPSCs.

**Differentiation Protocols for hPSCs**

Differentiating hPSCs into specific cell types, such as neurons or glia, involves intricate protocols that mimic developmental cues. These protocols often include the use of growth factors, small molecules, and transcription factors that guide the hPSCs through various developmental stages. For instance, to generate neuroectodermal cells, protocols typically involve the application of neural inducers such as BMP4, FGF2, and SHH.

**Applications of SOX2-Expressing Cells**

SOX2-expressing cells have significant potential in various applications. They can be used to create in vitro models of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, these cells can be used for regenerative therapies, including cell replacement strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.
