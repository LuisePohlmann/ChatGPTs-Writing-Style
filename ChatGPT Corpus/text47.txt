### Abstract

This study investigates the effects of halide doping on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) synthesized via aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD). TCOs, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc oxide (ZnO), are critical materials in various optoelectronic applications due to their high electrical conductivity and optical transparency. Halide doping is a promising approach to modify and enhance the properties of TCOs, but its effects on material characteristics during AACVD remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically examine the impact of doping TCOs with different halides, including fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I), on their structural, optical, and electrical properties. We employed AACVD to fabricate TCO films and characterized them using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Hall effect measurements. Our results reveal that halide doping significantly influences the film morphology, crystallinity, carrier concentration, and optical transmittance of TCOs. Specifically, fluorine doping led to the highest enhancement in electrical conductivity while maintaining high optical transparency. The study provides insights into the role of halide dopants in tuning the properties of TCOs and offers guidelines for optimizing TCO performance in practical applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are materials that combine high electrical conductivity with optical transparency, making them essential in a variety of electronic and optoelectronic devices. They are widely used in applications such as touchscreens, flat-panel displays, solar cells, and transparent electrodes. Among TCOs, indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are the most commonly used due to their excellent conductivity and transparency. However, optimizing the performance of these materials to meet specific application requirements remains a significant challenge.

Aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) is a versatile and effective method for fabricating TCO thin films. This technique involves the aerosolization of a precursor solution, which is then transported to the substrate and decomposed to form the desired thin film. AACVD offers several advantages, including the ability to deposit films at relatively low temperatures and on large-area substrates, making it suitable for industrial applications.

#### Halide Doping in TCOs

Halide doping is a technique used to modify the properties of TCOs by incorporating halide elements into the oxide lattice. Halides such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) have been studied for their effects on TCO properties. Doping with halides can influence various material characteristics, including:

1. **Electrical Conductivity**: Halide dopants can alter carrier concentration and mobility, affecting the electrical conductivity of TCOs.
2. **Optical Transparency**: The incorporation of halides can influence the optical transmittance of TCOs, which is crucial for maintaining transparency in optoelectronic applications.
3. **Crystallinity and Morphology**: Halide doping can impact the growth and morphology of TCO films, affecting their structural and surface properties.

Despite these potential benefits, the effects of halide doping on TCOs synthesized via AACVD have not been thoroughly investigated. Understanding how different halide dopants affect TCO properties can lead to improved performance in various applications.
