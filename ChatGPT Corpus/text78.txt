### Abstract

The construction of porous materials with tailored properties is crucial for various applications, including catalysis, sensing, and environmental remediation. This study presents the development of porous polysaccharide-supported cadmium sulfide (CdS) using a colloidal approach. Cadmium sulfide, a semiconductor with notable photocatalytic properties, is integrated with polysaccharide matrices to form a composite material exhibiting enhanced surface area and porosity. The process involves the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles within a polysaccharide matrix, followed by the formation of a porous structure through controlled solvent evaporation and templating methods. Detailed characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, are employed to assess the structural and functional properties of the resulting composites. The study evaluates the photocatalytic activity of the porous CdS-polysaccharide composites and their potential applications in environmental and energy-related fields. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using colloidal methods to create porous composites with desirable properties for various technological applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

The development of porous materials with high surface area and specific functional properties is a key area of research in materials science. Such materials find extensive applications in fields such as catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a well-known semiconductor with excellent photocatalytic properties, making it suitable for applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, to maximize the effectiveness of CdS, it is often advantageous to combine it with other materials to enhance its stability, surface area, and overall performance.

Polysaccharides, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, are natural polymers that offer several benefits, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of functionalization. When combined with CdS, polysaccharides can provide a support matrix that enhances the dispersion and stability of CdS nanoparticles while imparting additional functional properties. The formation of porous structures within these composites can further improve their performance by increasing surface area and facilitating better interaction with target molecules.
