### Abstract

Glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, has been noted for its potential impact on various soil-borne pathogens. This study investigates the effect of glyphosate on the growth of Macrophomina phaseolina, a pathogen responsible for charcoal rot in soybeans, both in vitro and in field conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to observe the direct impact of glyphosate on the mycelial growth of M. phaseolina, with various concentrations of the herbicide applied to the fungal cultures. Field experiments assessed the impact of glyphosate application on disease severity in soybean crops. Results indicated that glyphosate significantly inhibited the growth of M. phaseolina in vitro. Field data showed a notable reduction in disease severity and incidence in glyphosate-treated plots compared to untreated controls. These findings suggest that glyphosate could play a dual role in weed and pathogen management, potentially reducing the impact of M. phaseolina on soybean crops. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind glyphosate’s antifungal effects and its implications for integrated disease management strategies in soybean cultivation.

### Introduction

#### Background

Soybean (Glycine max) is a critical crop worldwide, valued for its protein-rich seeds and oil. However, soybean production is frequently challenged by various diseases, one of the most significant being charcoal rot, caused by the soil-borne fungus Macrophomina phaseolina. This pathogen thrives in hot, dry conditions and can cause substantial yield losses by infecting the roots and lower stems, leading to plant wilting and death.

Managing charcoal rot is complex due to the pathogen's ability to persist in the soil and its broad host range. Traditional disease management strategies include crop rotation, resistant varieties, and fungicide applications, but these methods often have limited effectiveness or are not economically viable. Therefore, there is a pressing need for alternative management strategies that can complement existing practices.

Glyphosate, a non-selective systemic herbicide, is extensively used in agriculture to control weeds. Beyond its herbicidal properties, glyphosate has been reported to affect various soil microorganisms, including pathogenic fungi. Some studies suggest that glyphosate may inhibit fungal growth, while others indicate it might enhance disease severity by affecting plant physiology or microbial communities in the rhizosphere.

#### Objectives

This study aims to explore the effects of glyphosate on M. phaseolina and its subsequent impact on disease severity in soybean crops. The specific objectives are:

1. To evaluate the direct impact of glyphosate on the mycelial growth of M. phaseolina in vitro.
2. To assess the effect of glyphosate application on charcoal rot severity in soybean fields.
3. To understand the potential mechanisms behind glyphosate’s influence on M. phaseolina and soybean disease dynamics.

#### Scope of the Study

The study is divided into two main components: in vitro experiments and field trials. The in vitro component involves growing M. phaseolina cultures on media supplemented with various concentrations of glyphosate to observe its impact on fungal growth. The field component consists of applying glyphosate to soybean crops and monitoring disease incidence and severity compared to untreated controls.

#### Methodology

1. **In Vitro Experiments**:
   - **Fungal Culture**: M. phaseolina isolates are cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates.
   - **Glyphosate Treatment**: Plates are amended with different concentrations of glyphosate (ranging from 0 to 1000 ppm).
   - **Growth Measurement**: Radial growth of fungal colonies is measured at regular intervals to assess the impact of glyphosate.

2. **Field Trials**:
   - **Site Selection**: Field trials are conducted in soybean-growing regions with a history of charcoal rot.
   - **Experimental Design**: Plots are treated with glyphosate at recommended agronomic rates, with untreated plots serving as controls.
   - **Disease Assessment**: Disease incidence and severity are evaluated at various growth stages of soybeans using standard protocols.

#### Literature Review

Previous research has produced mixed results regarding glyphosate’s impact on soil pathogens. For instance, **Johal and Huber (2009)** suggested that glyphosate might enhance certain plant diseases by altering soil microbial communities. Conversely, **Sanogo et al. (2000)** reported that glyphosate reduced the incidence of sudden death syndrome in glyphosate-resistant soybeans.

Studies specifically focusing on M. phaseolina have indicated variable responses to glyphosate. **Weir et al. (2001)** observed a reduction in M. phaseolina growth when exposed to glyphosate in vitro, while field studies have shown inconsistent effects on disease severity.

#### Importance of the Study

Understanding the interaction between glyphosate and M. phaseolina has significant implications for soybean disease management. If glyphosate can effectively reduce the growth and impact of M. phaseolina, it could serve as an additional tool for managing charcoal rot, particularly in glyphosate-resistant soybean varieties. This could lead to more integrated and sustainable disease management strategies, potentially reducing the reliance on fungicides and other chemical inputs.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Glyphosate**: A broad-spectrum systemic herbicide commonly used for weed control in various crops.
2. **Macrophomina phaseolina**: A soil-borne fungal pathogen causing charcoal rot in soybeans and other crops.
3. **Charcoal Rot**: A disease characterized by root and stem infection, leading to plant wilting and death, particularly under hot and dry conditions.
4. **In Vitro Experiments**: Laboratory-based studies conducted to observe the direct effects of glyphosate on fungal growth.
5. **Field Trials**: Experiments conducted in agricultural fields to assess the real-world impact of glyphosate on disease severity in crops.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

One practical application of this study is in the formulation of integrated disease management practices for soybean farmers. By understanding how glyphosate affects M. phaseolina, farmers can make more informed decisions about herbicide use, potentially integrating glyphosate applications with other cultural and biological controls to manage charcoal rot more effectively.

In addition, this research could inform breeding programs aimed at developing glyphosate-resistant soybean varieties with enhanced disease resistance. Understanding the dual role of glyphosate in weed and pathogen management could lead to the development of more resilient crop varieties.

#### Results and Discussion

The results section will present detailed findings from both the in vitro experiments and field trials:

- **In Vitro Results**: Graphs and tables showing the radial growth of M. phaseolina at different glyphosate concentrations, highlighting any significant inhibitory effects.
- **Field Trial Results**: Data on disease incidence and severity in treated and untreated plots, along with statistical analyses comparing the effectiveness of glyphosate in reducing charcoal rot symptoms.

The discussion will interpret these results, considering the broader implications for soybean disease management and potential mechanisms underlying glyphosate’s impact on M. phaseolina.

#### Conclusion

This study aims to advance the understanding of glyphosate's role in managing charcoal rot in soybeans caused by M. phaseolina. By demonstrating the inhibitory effects of glyphosate on fungal growth and its potential to reduce disease severity in the field, the research provides valuable insights into integrated disease management strategies. These findings could help optimize glyphosate use in soybean cultivation, contributing to more sustainable and effective agricultural practices.

#### Future Work

Future research directions include:

1. **Mechanistic Studies**: Investigating the molecular and physiological mechanisms by which glyphosate affects M. phaseolina and soybean plant interactions.
2. **Long-term Field Studies**: Conducting long-term trials to evaluate the consistency of glyphosate’s effects on charcoal rot across different environmental conditions and growing seasons.
3. **Microbial Community Analysis**: Assessing the impact of glyphosate on soil microbial communities to understand its broader ecological effects and potential implications for soil health.
4. **Integration with Other Control Measures**: Exploring the synergistic effects of combining glyphosate with other cultural, biological, and chemical control methods for managing charcoal rot in soybeans.

By addressing these areas, future research can build on the findings of this study and contribute to the development of more comprehensive and sustainable disease management strategies in soybean agriculture.
