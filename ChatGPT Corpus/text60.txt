### Abstract

Surface roughness is a critical parameter affecting the performance of various optical, electronic, and mechanical systems. Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) has emerged as a versatile material for surface planarization due to its unique properties and ease of application. This study investigates the effectiveness of spray-coated HSQ reflow in reducing surface roughness on different substrates. By analyzing the reflow process under various conditions, including temperature and coating thickness, we quantify the improvements in surface smoothness. Surface roughness measurements before and after reflow were conducted using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results demonstrate that spray-coated HSQ reflow significantly reduces surface roughness, making it a promising technique for applications requiring highly planar surfaces.

### Introduction

#### Background

Surface roughness plays a pivotal role in the performance and reliability of numerous technological applications, ranging from semiconductor devices to optical components and biomedical implants. In these applications, surface irregularities can lead to scattering losses, electrical noise, mechanical wear, and reduced efficiency. Therefore, achieving low surface roughness is essential for enhancing device performance and extending their operational lifetimes.

Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) is a spin-on-glass material commonly used in microelectronics and nanotechnology due to its excellent planarization properties and compatibility with various substrates. When applied as a coating, HSQ undergoes a thermal reflow process, during which it becomes fluid and flows to fill surface asperities, thereby smoothing the surface. This process is particularly advantageous for fabricating devices with stringent surface smoothness requirements.

Traditional methods of applying HSQ involve spin coating, which, while effective, has limitations in terms of uniformity and scalability for larger or irregularly shaped surfaces. Spray coating offers a promising alternative, providing a more uniform application over large areas and complex geometries. This study focuses on the effectiveness of spray-coated HSQ reflow in reducing surface roughness, exploring the optimal conditions for achieving the best results.
