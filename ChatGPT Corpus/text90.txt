### Abstract

This study explores the delivery of chirality from a chiral coordination complex to its resulting supramolecular architecture through the establishment of multiple and helical hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions. By synthesizing chiral coordination complexes and promoting their self-assembly, we investigated how these complexes transfer their chiral information to the larger supramolecular structures. Spectroscopic techniques, including circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray crystallography, were employed to elucidate the chirality at different hierarchical levels. The findings demonstrate that the chiral coordination complexes effectively impart their chirality to the supramolecular architectures, with the helical hydrogen bonding playing a crucial role in maintaining and propagating the chiral information. This research provides insights into the design of chiral materials with potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, enantioselective sensors, and chiral photonic devices.

### Introduction

#### Background

Chirality, or "handedness," is a fundamental property of molecules that is crucial in many areas of chemistry, biology, and materials science. Chiral molecules exist in two non-superimposable mirror-image forms, known as enantiomers, which can exhibit drastically different behaviors and properties, especially in biological systems. The ability to control and transfer chirality at different hierarchical levels is a significant challenge with broad implications, particularly in the development of chiral materials and catalysts.

Coordination chemistry, which involves the bonding of metal ions with ligands, provides a versatile platform for creating chiral complexes. These chiral coordination complexes can serve as building blocks for larger supramolecular structures, where the arrangement and interactions of these units lead to the emergence of new properties. Among the various interactions that facilitate the self-assembly of supramolecular structures, hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) is particularly notable due to its directionality and strength.

Helical structures, which are common in biological systems, represent a unique form of chirality and are often stabilized by hydrogen bonding. The formation of helical supramolecular architectures through the self-assembly of chiral coordination complexes, mediated by multiple and helical hydrogen bonds, offers a promising strategy for transferring chirality from the molecular to the macroscopic level.

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Synthesize Chiral Coordination Complexes**: Develop methods for synthesizing chiral coordination complexes that can serve as building blocks for supramolecular structures.
2. **Promote Self-Assembly**: Investigate the conditions under which these chiral coordination complexes self-assemble into larger architectures through hydrogen bonding.
3. **Characterize Chirality Transfer**: Use spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and X-ray crystallography to characterize the transfer of chirality from the coordination complexes to the supramolecular structures.
4. **Analyze the Role of H-Bonding**: Examine the role of multiple and helical hydrogen bonding in the stabilization and propagation of chirality in the resulting supramolecular architectures.

#### Synthesis of Chiral Coordination Complexes

Chiral coordination complexes were synthesized using enantiopure ligands and metal ions. The ligands were designed to contain functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds, facilitating the self-assembly process. The general synthetic route involved the coordination of metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), and Co(II) with chiral ligands derived from amino acids or other chiral precursors. The synthesis was optimized to ensure high yield and purity of the chiral complexes.

#### Promotion of Self-Assembly

The self-assembly of the chiral coordination complexes into supramolecular architectures was promoted by dissolving the complexes in suitable solvents and allowing them to undergo slow evaporation or recrystallization. Conditions such as temperature, solvent polarity, and concentration were varied to optimize the self-assembly process. The formation of supramolecular structures was monitored using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

#### Spectroscopic Characterization

To characterize the chirality of the coordination complexes and their supramolecular assemblies, several spectroscopic techniques were employed:

1. **Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy**: CD was used to measure the optical activity of the chiral complexes and the supramolecular structures, providing information on the chirality transfer.
2. **X-ray Crystallography**: X-ray diffraction studies were conducted to determine the precise arrangement of atoms in the complexes and the supramolecular structures, revealing the role of hydrogen bonding in maintaining chirality.
3. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**: NMR was used to investigate the local environment of the hydrogen bonds and the coordination geometry.

#### Role of Hydrogen Bonding

The role of multiple and helical hydrogen bonding in the formation and stabilization of the supramolecular architectures was analyzed by studying the hydrogen-bonding patterns in the X-ray crystal structures. The presence of helical hydrogen bonds was confirmed through detailed structural analysis, and their contribution to the overall chirality of the supramolecular structures was assessed.

#### Importance of the Study

This study contributes to the understanding of chirality transfer from molecular to macroscopic levels through the design and self-assembly of chiral coordination complexes. By elucidating the mechanisms by which multiple and helical hydrogen bonds propagate chirality, this research offers valuable insights into the design of new chiral materials. These materials have potential applications in areas such as asymmetric catalysis, where chirality is crucial for the selectivity of catalytic processes, and in the development of chiral sensors and photonic devices.

1. **Chirality**: The property of a molecule that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image.
2. **Coordination Complexes**: Compounds consisting of a central metal ion bonded to surrounding ligands.
3. **Supramolecular Chemistry**: The study of entities formed by the association of two or more chemical species held together by non-covalent interactions.
4. **Hydrogen Bonding**: A type of dipole-dipole interaction between a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom and another electronegative atom.
5. **Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy**: A spectroscopic technique used to measure the difference in the absorption of left-handed versus right-handed circularly polarized light.

Spectroscopic data will be analyzed to confirm the transfer of chirality and to elucidate the role of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the helical structures.
