### Abstract

Understanding flow structure and near-field dispersion in urban environments is crucial for various applications, including air quality management, urban planning, and hazard mitigation. This study investigates the flow dynamics and dispersion patterns within arrays of building-like obstacles, which simulate urban environments. Using a combination of wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we analyze how different configurations of building arrays affect flow structure and pollutant dispersion. The results reveal complex interactions between buildings that significantly influence airflow patterns and pollutant spread. We identify key factors such as building height, spacing, and arrangement that govern these dynamics. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing urban layouts that optimize ventilation and minimize pollutant exposure, contributing to healthier and safer urban environments.

### Introduction

#### Background

Urban environments are characterized by a dense concentration of buildings and other structures that profoundly influence local airflow and pollutant dispersion. The flow structure within these environments is complex, affected by the interaction between wind and the built environment.

Building-like obstacles, such as arrays of simplified geometric structures, are commonly used in research to model urban environments. These models allow for controlled experiments and simulations that can reveal fundamental insights into flow dynamics and pollutant dispersion. By studying the flow structure and dispersion patterns in these arrays, researchers can develop strategies to improve urban air quality and overall environmental health.
