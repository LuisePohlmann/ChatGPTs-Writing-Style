### Abstract

This study examines the response of Jupiter’s thermosphere to a transient ‘pulse’ in solar wind pressure, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the solar wind and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere. Utilizing data from the Juno spacecraft and ground-based observations, we analyze the thermospheric responses to sudden increases in solar wind pressure, which are characterized by intensified magnetospheric activity and atmospheric perturbations. Our findings reveal that such transient pulses induce significant thermal and compositional changes in the thermosphere, including variations in temperature, density, and composition. These results enhance our understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics and the impact of solar wind variability on giant planet atmospheres. The study contributes to the broader understanding of planetary magnetospheres and their interactions with the solar wind, offering insights relevant to space weather effects on giant planets.

### Introduction

#### Background

Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, possesses a complex and dynamic atmosphere that is significantly influenced by its interaction with the solar wind. Unlike Earth, which has a relatively stable magnetosphere, Jupiter's magnetosphere is characterized by intense solar wind interactions due to its strong magnetic field and substantial size. The thermosphere, the upper layer of Jupiter's atmosphere, is particularly sensitive to variations in solar wind pressure, which can lead to transient changes in atmospheric properties and magnetospheric dynamics.

Transient pulses in solar wind pressure occur when solar wind conditions suddenly change, leading to short-lived increases in solar wind pressure. These pulses can cause rapid and significant alterations in the magnetosphere's interaction with the planet's atmosphere, resulting in observable effects such as increased ionization, heating, and changes in atmospheric composition.

#### Motivation

Studying the response of Jupiter’s thermosphere to transient pulses in solar wind pressure is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Understanding Thermospheric Dynamics**: Examining how Jupiter's thermosphere responds to variations in solar wind pressure helps us understand the thermal and compositional dynamics of its upper atmosphere.
2. **Impact on Magnetospheric Activity**: Transient solar wind pulses can trigger changes in magnetospheric activity, which in turn affect atmospheric processes. Understanding these interactions is essential for comprehending the broader impact of solar wind on planetary atmospheres.
3. **Comparative Planetology**: Insights gained from studying Jupiter's response to solar wind pulses can be compared with similar studies on other planets, contributing to a better understanding of planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres.

An example of the application of this study is analyzing how a transient solar wind pulse leads to increased ionization and heating in Jupiter’s thermosphere. For instance, if a pulse causes a significant rise in thermospheric temperature, this information could be used to refine atmospheric models and improve our understanding of heat transport in giant planet atmospheres.
