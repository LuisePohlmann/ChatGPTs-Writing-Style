### Abstract

The Sleipner CO2 storage project in the Utsira Formation of the North Sea represents a significant effort in mitigating atmospheric carbon emissions through geological storage. A critical aspect of ensuring the efficacy and safety of such storage sites is understanding the behavior of CO2 plumes within the subsurface. This study investigates the capillary flow dynamics of a layered CO2 plume at the Sleipner site, highlighting the necessity of incorporating fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation for accurate modeling. Through advanced numerical simulations and geological data analysis, the research delineates how fractured shale layers influence plume migration and stability, offering insights into optimizing CO2 storage strategies.

### Introduction

#### Background

The escalating levels of atmospheric CO2 due to anthropogenic activities have necessitated the development of effective carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Geological storage, particularly in deep saline aquifers, has emerged as a viable solution to sequester CO2 and mitigate climate change impacts. The Sleipner CO2 storage project, initiated in 1996, is one of the world's first and longest-running industrial-scale CO2 storage projects. Located within the Utsira Formation in the North Sea, the project injects approximately one million tonnes of CO2 annually into a deep saline reservoir.

Understanding the subsurface behavior of the injected CO2 is paramount for assessing the long-term storage security and environmental safety of such projects. The migration of CO2 plumes is governed by complex geological and hydrodynamic factors, including reservoir heterogeneity, fluid dynamics, and capillary forces. Accurate modeling of these processes is essential to predict plume behavior and optimize storage strategies.

#### Problem Statement

One of the critical challenges in modeling CO2 plume migration in geological formations is accounting for the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface. The Utsira Formation, like many geological formations, exhibits layers of varying permeability and porosity. These variations can significantly influence the movement and distribution of CO2 plumes. In particular, shale layers, which are often present as barriers or baffles within the reservoir, play a crucial role in controlling fluid flow.

Traditional models that assume homogenous or uniformly layered reservoirs may fail to capture the intricate dynamics of CO2 plume migration in such heterogeneous systems. Recent studies suggest that fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation could significantly affect the capillary flow and overall behavior of the CO2 plume. However, the extent and impact of these fractures are not well understood, necessitating detailed investigation and advanced modeling approaches.

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Develop a detailed capillary flow model for the Sleipner CO2 plume considering the heterogeneity of the Utsira Formation.**
2. **Incorporate the effects of fractured shale barriers into the model to understand their impact on CO2 migration and stability.**
3. **Use numerical simulations to predict the behavior of the CO2 plume and identify optimal strategies for enhancing storage security.**
4. **Validate the model using available geological and injection data from the Sleipner site.**

#### Literature Review

Numerous studies have focused on the Sleipner CO2 storage project, providing valuable insights into various aspects of geological storage. Early research by Arts et al. (2004) documented the initial observations of CO2 plume behavior using time-lapse seismic monitoring. Subsequent studies have explored different modeling approaches to predict plume migration, including Darcy flow models, capillary pressure-saturation relationships, and reactive transport simulations (Chadwick et al., 2006; Eiken et al., 2011).

However, the role of fractured shale barriers in influencing CO2 flow has received limited attention. Shale barriers can act as semi-permeable layers that either impede or redirect CO2 flow depending on their permeability and fracture density. Recent advances in understanding shale permeability and the characterization of fractures have opened new avenues for incorporating these features into CO2 plume models (Gaus et al., 2008; Hovorka et al., 2013).

#### Methodology

This study employs a multi-faceted approach combining geological data analysis, numerical simulations, and model validation to achieve the research objectives.

**Geological Data Analysis**

Detailed geological data from the Sleipner site, including core samples, well logs, and seismic surveys, are analyzed to characterize the stratigraphy and identify the presence and properties of shale layers within the Utsira Formation. Special attention is given to identifying fractures and their spatial distribution.

**Numerical Simulations**

A capillary flow model is developed using the TOUGH2/ECO2N simulator, which is designed for modeling multiphase fluid flow in porous media. The model incorporates heterogeneous permeability and porosity distributions derived from geological data. Fractured shale barriers are represented using dual-permeability and dual-porosity approaches to capture the impact of fractures on fluid flow.

**Simulation Scenarios**

Multiple simulation scenarios are conducted to evaluate the effects of different fracture properties (e.g., fracture density, orientation, and permeability) on CO2 plume migration. These scenarios help to identify the critical factors influencing plume behavior and storage security.

**Model Validation**

The simulation results are validated against historical injection data and time-lapse seismic monitoring data from the Sleipner site. The model's predictive capability is assessed by comparing simulated plume migration patterns with observed data.

#### Results

The numerical simulations reveal that fractured shale barriers significantly influence CO2 plume migration within the Utsira Formation. Key findings include:

- **Plume Retardation and Diversion**: Fractured shale layers retard the upward migration of CO2, causing lateral diversion and enhancing plume spreading.
- **Enhanced Capillary Trapping**: The presence of fractures increases capillary trapping efficiency by creating additional interfaces for CO2 to be trapped.
- **Impact of Fracture Properties**: The density and orientation of fractures within shale layers critically determine the extent of their impact on CO2 migration. Higher fracture densities and vertically oriented fractures tend to enhance plume retardation and lateral spreading.

#### Discussion

The findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed geological features, such as fractured shale barriers, into CO2 plume models. Traditional homogeneous models fail to capture the complexities introduced by these features, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions of plume behavior and storage security.

This study highlights the need for advanced characterization techniques to accurately identify and parameterize fractures within shale layers. Additionally, the integration of multi-disciplinary approaches, combining geological, geophysical, and engineering expertise, is essential for developing robust models for CO2 storage.

#### Conclusion

This research provides valuable insights into the capillary flow dynamics of CO2 plumes in the presence of fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation. The developed model offers a more accurate representation of plume migration, contributing to the optimization of CO2 storage strategies at the Sleipner site and similar geological settings.

Future work will focus on refining the fracture characterization methods and exploring the long-term stability of CO2 plumes under varying injection scenarios and geological conditions. This study paves the way for more reliable and efficient geological storage of CO2, contributing to global efforts in mitigating climate change.
