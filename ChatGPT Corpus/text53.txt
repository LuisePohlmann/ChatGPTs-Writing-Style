### Abstract

Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) are pivotal in understanding and diagnosing the complex behavior of fluid flows, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) environments where traditional 2D analyses fall short. This study addresses the diagnostic challenges and methodologies for identifying and characterizing LCS in 3D flows, extending beyond the conventional flatland analysis. By utilizing advanced techniques such as finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE), material deformation fields, and three-dimensional visualization tools, we provide a comprehensive framework for detecting and analyzing LCS in complex 3D flow fields. We present a series of case studies across different flow scenarios, including atmospheric and oceanic currents, to illustrate the application of these techniques and their effectiveness in revealing the intricate structures and dynamics within the flow. Our findings highlight the importance of 3D diagnostics for understanding transport, mixing, and coherence in fluid systems, offering new insights into the behavior of LCS and their implications for scientific and engineering applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) play a crucial role in the analysis of fluid dynamics by identifying regions of coherent motion within a flow field. These structures are significant for understanding various phenomena, including transport, mixing, and the evolution of flow patterns. While much of the foundational work on LCS has been conducted in two-dimensional (2D) flows, real-world applications often involve three-dimensional (3D) environments where the complexities of flow dynamics are significantly greater. In 3D flows, the detection and characterization of LCS become more challenging due to the increased dimensionality and the intricate nature of flow structures.

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as the use of 2D finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE), are limited in their ability to capture the full complexity of 3D flows. As a result, there is a growing need for advanced diagnostic techniques that can effectively analyze and visualize LCS in three-dimensional contexts. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring methodologies for the detection and analysis of LCS in 3D flows, using a combination of numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and visualization techniques.
