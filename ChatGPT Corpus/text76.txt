### Introduction

#### Background

Thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules have emerged as a prominent alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells due to their lightweight, flexible, and potentially lower-cost characteristics. These modules are fabricated using a variety of materials, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The thin-film approach offers several advantages such as reduced material usage and easier integration into various surfaces. However, the performance of thin-film PV modules is heavily influenced by multiple factors that affect their energy delivery and overall efficiency.

The energy delivery of a PV module refers to its ability to convert sunlight into electrical energy effectively. This efficiency can be impacted by material properties, such as the optical absorption and electronic properties of the thin-film layers, as well as structural and environmental factors. Understanding these influences is crucial for optimizing thin-film PV technology and improving its performance in real-world applications.
