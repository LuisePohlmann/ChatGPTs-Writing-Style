### Abstract

Urban environments present unique challenges for wind profiling due to the complex interplay of buildings, vegetation, and other structures that affect wind patterns. This study assesses the efficacy of a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method for use in such urban settings. By utilizing Doppler lidar technology, which measures the velocity of particles in the atmosphere to determine wind speed and direction, we aim to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and practical applicability of this method in urban environments. The assessment involves field experiments conducted in various urban areas with differing characteristics, such as dense high-rise districts and more open, low-rise regions. We analyze the performance of the three-beam system in capturing wind profiles and compare its results with conventional wind measurement techniques. Our findings indicate that the three-beam Doppler lidar provides robust wind profiling capabilities in urban areas, offering significant advantages in terms of spatial resolution and data accuracy. The study highlights the potential of this technology for improving urban wind monitoring and management, with implications for air quality assessment, weather forecasting, and urban planning.

### Introduction

#### Background

Urban areas are characterized by complex wind patterns due to the interaction between wind flows and the built environment, including buildings, streets, and other structures. Accurate wind profiling is essential for various applications, such as assessing air quality, optimizing building ventilation, and improving weather forecasts. Traditional wind measurement techniques, such as anemometers and weather balloons, often fall short in urban environments due to their limited spatial resolution and inability to capture the detailed wind patterns influenced by urban structures.

Doppler lidar technology, which uses laser pulses to measure the velocity of particles in the atmosphere, offers a promising solution for urban wind profiling. This technology can provide high-resolution, three-dimensional wind profiles, making it suitable for capturing the intricate wind patterns present in urban settings. The three-beam Doppler lidar system, in particular, offers enhanced capabilities by measuring wind velocities in multiple directions simultaneously, improving the accuracy and reliability of wind profiles.
