### Abstract

This study investigates the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, coordination chemistry, and biological activities of novel organometallic complexes derived from thio-Schiff base ligands. The thio-Schiff base ligands were synthesized via the condensation reaction of aromatic aldehydes with thiosemicarbazide. These ligands were then reacted with various metal salts to form organometallic complexes. The resulting complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques including IR, UV-Vis, NMR, and X-ray diffraction. The coordination behavior of the ligands was studied in detail, revealing their chelating properties and the formation of stable metal-ligand complexes. Additionally, the biological activities of these complexes, including their antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic effects, were evaluated. The results indicate that these organometallic complexes exhibit significant biological activities, suggesting their potential use in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Organometallic complexes have garnered considerable attention in recent years due to their diverse applications in catalysis, materials science, and medicine. Among these, complexes derived from Schiff base ligands are of particular interest due to their structural versatility and ability to stabilize various metal ions in different oxidation states. Schiff bases, which are typically formed by the condensation of primary amines with carbonyl compounds, have been extensively studied for their coordination chemistry and biological properties.

Thio-Schiff bases are a subclass of Schiff bases where the imine nitrogen is adjacent to a sulfur atom. This unique structure endows thio-Schiff bases with distinct electronic and steric properties, enhancing their ability to coordinate with metal ions and form stable complexes. These ligands have shown promise in the development of metal-based drugs, particularly due to their potential antimicrobial and anticancer activities.

#### Objectives

The main objectives of this study are to:

1. **Synthesize Thio-Schiff Base Ligands**: Develop efficient synthetic routes for thio-Schiff base ligands using aromatic aldehydes and thiosemicarbazide.
2. **Prepare Organometallic Complexes**: React these ligands with various metal salts to form organometallic complexes.
3. **Characterize the Complexes**: Use spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-Vis, NMR, X-ray diffraction) to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of the complexes.
4. **Evaluate Biological Activities**: Assess the antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic activities of the synthesized complexes.

#### Synthesis of Thio-Schiff Base Ligands

Thio-Schiff bases are synthesized through a condensation reaction between aromatic aldehydes and thiosemicarbazide. This reaction typically occurs under reflux conditions in an ethanol solvent, resulting in the formation of the desired thio-Schiff base ligands. The general reaction scheme is:

\[ \text{Aromatic aldehyde} + \text{Thiosemicarbazide} \rightarrow \text{Thio-Schiff base ligand} + \text{Water} \]

The synthesized ligands are purified by recrystallization and characterized using various analytical techniques to confirm their structure.

#### Preparation of Organometallic Complexes

The purified thio-Schiff base ligands are then reacted with metal salts such as copper(II) chloride, nickel(II) nitrate, and cobalt(II) acetate to form the corresponding organometallic complexes. The general reaction scheme for the formation of metal complexes is:

\[ \text{Thio-Schiff base ligand} + \text{Metal salt} \rightarrow \text{Metal-ligand complex} \]

These reactions are typically carried out in an ethanol or methanol solvent, and the resulting complexes are isolated by filtration, washed, and dried.

3. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**: Helps in elucidating the structural details of the complexes, particularly the ligand framework.
4. **X-ray Diffraction**: Used to determine the crystal structure of the complexes, providing detailed information on the arrangement of atoms and the geometry of the coordination complex.

#### Coordination Chemistry

The coordination behavior of the thio-Schiff base ligands is explored by studying their interaction with different metal ions. The ligands typically act as bidentate or tridentate chelating agents, coordinating through the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. The nature of the metal-ligand bond and the geometry of the resulting complexes are investigated to understand the coordination chemistry in detail.
