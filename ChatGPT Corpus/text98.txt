### Abstract

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) associated with progranulin (PGRN) deficiency is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. This study aimed to develop and characterize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of PGRN-deficient FTD and to uncover specific and reversible neuronal defects associated with this condition. iPSCs were generated from fibroblasts of FTD patients with known progranulin mutations and from healthy controls. These iPSCs were differentiated into cortical neurons, and their phenotypes were analyzed. Our results revealed that PGRN-deficient neurons exhibited defects in neurite outgrowth, synaptic function, and lysosomal activity. Notably, these defects were reversible upon treatment with recombinant progranulin or small molecules targeting lysosomal function. This study provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PGRN-deficient FTD and highlights potential therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.

### Introduction

#### Background

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to behavioral changes, language deficits, and cognitive decline. FTD is the second most common form of dementia in individuals under the age of 65, after Alzheimer's disease. The etiology of FTD is heterogeneous, with genetic mutations playing a significant role in a substantial subset of cases.

One of the major genetic causes of FTD is haploinsufficiency of the progranulin (PGRN) gene. Progranulin is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation, lysosomal function, and neuronal survival. Mutations in the PGRN gene lead to reduced levels of progranulin, resulting in neurodegeneration. The exact mechanisms by which progranulin deficiency causes FTD remain unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that disrupted lysosomal function and impaired neuronal connectivity may play critical roles.

#### Problem Statement

Current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PGRN-deficient FTD is limited by the lack of appropriate human models. Animal models, while useful, do not fully recapitulate the human disease, and primary human neuronal cultures are difficult to obtain and maintain. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising solution to this problem by providing a source of patient-specific cells that can be differentiated into various cell types, including neurons, for disease modeling.

Despite the potential of iPSCs in modeling neurodegenerative diseases, there are still challenges in generating and characterizing iPSC-derived neurons that accurately reflect disease phenotypes. Furthermore, identifying reversible neuronal defects and potential therapeutic targets in PGRN-deficient FTD remains a significant challenge.

#### Objectives

The objectives of this study are:

1. **To generate iPSCs from fibroblasts of patients with progranulin-deficient FTD and healthy controls.**
2. **To differentiate these iPSCs into cortical neurons and characterize their phenotypes.**
3. **To identify specific neuronal defects associated with progranulin deficiency.**
4. **To evaluate the reversibility of these defects through treatment with recombinant progranulin and lysosomal function-targeting compounds.**

#### Literature Review

The discovery of iPSCs by Yamanaka and colleagues in 2006 revolutionized the field of biomedical research, offering a powerful tool for modeling human diseases in vitro. iPSCs are generated by reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state using a set of transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). These cells can then be differentiated into any cell type, making them invaluable for studying disease mechanisms and screening potential therapeutics.

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, iPSC-derived neurons have been used to model various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These models have provided critical insights into disease mechanisms and have facilitated the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Progranulin-deficient FTD has been modeled using iPSCs, but comprehensive studies investigating specific neuronal defects and their reversibility are still needed. Previous studies have suggested that PGRN deficiency leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired neuronal connectivity, but these findings require further validation and exploration.

#### Methodology

**Cell Reprogramming and iPSC Generation**

Fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of FTD patients carrying known PGRN mutations and from age-matched healthy controls. These fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a non-integrating episomal vector system expressing the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The iPSCs were cultured in defined conditions and characterized for pluripotency markers.

**Differentiation into Cortical Neurons**

The generated iPSCs were differentiated into cortical neurons using a defined differentiation protocol. Briefly, iPSCs were cultured in neural induction medium to form neural rosettes, which were then expanded and differentiated into cortical neurons. Neuronal identity was confirmed through immunostaining for neuronal markers such as TUJ1, MAP2, and NeuN.

**Phenotypic Characterization**

The phenotypes of PGRN-deficient and control neurons were analyzed. Neurite outgrowth was assessed using immunocytochemistry and image analysis software. Synaptic function was evaluated by measuring synapse density and assessing synaptic protein levels through western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Lysosomal function was analyzed using lysosomal staining and enzymatic activity assays.

**Reversibility Studies**

To evaluate the reversibility of neuronal defects, PGRN-deficient neurons were treated with recombinant progranulin and small molecules targeting lysosomal function. The effects of these treatments on neurite outgrowth, synaptic function, and lysosomal activity were assessed as described above.

#### Results

**Generation and Characterization of iPSCs**

Fibroblasts from FTD patients and healthy controls were successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs. The generated iPSCs expressed pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Nanog, SSEA-4, and Tra-1-60. Karyotyping confirmed the genetic stability of the iPSCs, and sequencing verified the presence of PGRN mutations in patient-derived iPSCs.

**Differentiation into Cortical Neurons**

Both PGRN-deficient and control iPSCs efficiently differentiated into cortical neurons. These neurons expressed typical neuronal markers (TUJ1, MAP2, NeuN) and formed functional neuronal networks, as evidenced by electrophysiological recordings.

**Neuronal Defects in PGRN-Deficient Neurons**

PGRN-deficient neurons exhibited significant defects in neurite outgrowth, with shorter and less branched neurites compared to controls. Synaptic function was also impaired, as indicated by reduced synapse density and lower levels of synaptic proteins such as synapsin and PSD-95. Lysosomal activity was disrupted, with decreased lysosomal staining intensity and reduced enzymatic activity of lysosomal hydrolases.

**Reversibility of Neuronal Defects**

Treatment of PGRN-deficient neurons with recombinant progranulin restored neurite outgrowth and synaptic function to levels comparable to those in control neurons. Small molecules targeting lysosomal function also ameliorated lysosomal defects and improved neuronal phenotypes. These findings demonstrate the reversibility of neuronal defects in PGRN-deficient FTD and highlight potential therapeutic strategies.

#### Discussion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of neuronal defects associated with PGRN deficiency in FTD using patient-specific iPSC models. Our findings reveal specific impairments in neurite outgrowth, synaptic function, and lysosomal activity in PGRN-deficient neurons. Importantly, these defects are reversible upon treatment with recombinant progranulin or lysosomal function-targeting compounds.

The use of iPSC-derived neurons offers a physiologically relevant model for studying FTD and allows for the investigation of patient-specific genetic backgrounds. Our results support the hypothesis that lysosomal dysfunction plays a critical role in PGRN-deficient FTD and suggest that targeting lysosomal pathways may be a viable therapeutic approach.

#### Conclusion

This study demonstrates the utility of iPSC models in uncovering specific and reversible neuronal defects in progranulin-deficient frontotemporal dementia. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PGRN-deficient FTD and highlight potential therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease. Future research should focus on further elucidating the mechanisms underlying these neuronal defects and exploring the therapeutic potential of lysosomal function-targeting compounds in clinical settings.
