### Abstract

This study investigates the sets of lengths in maximal orders within central simple algebras. Sets of lengths, integral to understanding non-unique factorizations in algebraic structures, are examined in the context of central simple algebras to discern patterns and structural properties. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and computational techniques, we explore the relationship between the algebraic properties of central simple algebras and the behavior of lengths in their maximal orders. Our results contribute to a deeper comprehension of factorization theory in non-commutative settings and have implications for broader applications in algebra and number theory.

### Introduction

#### Background

Central simple algebras (CSAs) are a fundamental class of algebras with profound implications in various branches of mathematics, including representation theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory. A central simple algebra over a field \( K \) is a finite-dimensional algebra that is simple and has its center exactly equal to \( K \). The study of maximal orders in these algebras offers insights into the structure and properties of these algebras.

A maximal order in a CSA is a subring that is as large as possible while still being contained within the algebra. These maximal orders exhibit intriguing algebraic properties and are pivotal in understanding the arithmetic of the CSA. One important aspect of this arithmetic is the analysis of sets of lengths, which pertain to the factorization of elements within these orders.

Sets of lengths in an algebraic structure reflect the different ways an element can be expressed as a product of irreducible elements (atoms). In commutative settings, such as the integers or polynomial rings, these sets provide valuable information about the nature of factorizations. Extending this concept to maximal orders in CSAs presents new challenges and opportunities for discovering unique algebraic behaviors.

#### Motivation

Studying sets of lengths in maximal orders within CSAs is motivated by several key factors:

1. **Non-Unique Factorization**: Understanding the non-unique factorization properties in non-commutative settings expands our knowledge beyond commutative algebra and number theory.
2. **Structural Insights**: Sets of lengths reveal structural nuances of maximal orders and their elements, providing deeper insights into the arithmetic of CSAs.
3. **Broad Applications**: Results in this area have potential applications in various mathematical fields, including module theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptography.

While the theory of sets of lengths is well-developed in commutative algebra, extending these concepts to the non-commutative setting of CSAs, particularly within their maximal orders, remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap and contribute to a richer understanding of factorization in non-commutative algebraic structures.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. **Characterize Sets of Lengths**: Identify and analyze the sets of lengths in maximal orders within various CSAs.
2. **Determine Structural Properties**: Investigate the relationship between the algebraic properties of CSAs and the behavior of sets of lengths in their maximal orders.
3. **Develop Computational Techniques**: Utilize and develop computational methods to assist in the analysis of sets of lengths in complex algebraic structures.

The scope of this study includes theoretical analysis supported by computational experiments. We will explore specific examples of CSAs and their maximal orders, identify patterns in the sets of lengths, and interpret these patterns in the context of the algebra's structure.

#### Methodology

1. **Theoretical Framework**: Develop the theoretical basis for analyzing sets of lengths in maximal orders, including definitions, properties, and relevant theorems from the theory of CSAs and non-commutative ring theory.
2. **Case Studies**: Select specific examples of CSAs, such as matrix algebras over number fields, and their maximal orders. Analyze the sets of lengths for elements within these orders.
3. **Computational Analysis**: Employ computational tools to handle complex calculations and verify theoretical predictions. Use algorithms to compute sets of lengths for elements in maximal orders.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the behavior of sets of lengths in maximal orders with those in commutative settings and identify unique features specific to the non-commutative context.

#### Literature Review

The study of factorization in algebraic structures has a rich history, particularly in commutative algebra. Sets of lengths have been extensively studied in domains like the integers, polynomial rings, and Dedekind domains. These studies have revealed deep connections between factorization properties and the arithmetic structure of the domain.

In non-commutative settings, the theory is less developed but has seen significant advancements. Research on maximal orders in CSAs has highlighted their complex arithmetic, including the role of units, ideal theory, and representations. Some work has addressed factorization properties in non-commutative rings, but the specific analysis of sets of lengths in maximal orders remains an open and intriguing area of study.

#### Importance of Studying Sets of Lengths in CSAs

Understanding sets of lengths in maximal orders of CSAs is important for several reasons:

1. **Insight into Non-Unique Factorizations**: This study helps generalize the concept of non-unique factorizations to non-commutative settings, revealing new algebraic phenomena.
2. **Algebraic Structure**: Analyzing sets of lengths provides insights into the internal structure of maximal orders, aiding in the broader understanding of CSAs.
3. **Applications**: Results can influence various fields, including the study of arithmetic groups, algebraic K-theory, and the theory of orders in division algebras.

#### Key Theoretical Concepts

1. **Central Simple Algebras**: These are algebras that are simple and have their center equal to the underlying field, playing a crucial role in non-commutative algebra.
2. **Maximal Orders**: Subrings of CSAs that are as large as possible, containing rich arithmetic properties.
3. **Sets of Lengths**: The sets of possible lengths of factorizations of an element into irreducible elements, revealing the nature of non-unique factorizations.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

Consider the CSA \( M_n(K) \), the algebra of \( n \times n \) matrices over a number field \( K \). The maximal orders in \( M_n(K) \) can be studied to identify sets of lengths for elements expressed as products of irreducibles. By analyzing these examples, we can determine patterns in factorization lengths and relate them to the algebra's structural properties, such as the norm, trace, and eigenvalues of matrices.

#### Results and Discussion

The results section will present the main findings from the theoretical analysis and computational experiments. We will detail the sets of lengths for elements in selected maximal orders, highlight observed patterns, and interpret these findings in the context of the algebraic structure of CSAs. The discussion will compare these results with those in commutative settings, emphasizing unique features of non-commutative factorization.

#### Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of sets of lengths in maximal orders within central simple algebras, highlighting the intricate interplay between non-commutative algebraic structures and factorization properties. Our findings enhance the understanding of non-unique factorizations in CSAs, contributing to the broader field of algebra and number theory. These results have significant implications for theoretical research and potential applications in various mathematical disciplines.
