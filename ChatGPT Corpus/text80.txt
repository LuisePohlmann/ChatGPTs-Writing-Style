### Abstract

Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are gaining prominence in wind energy generation due to their ability to capture wind from all directions and their suitability for urban and low-wind-speed environments. However, optimizing the control systems for VAWTs is challenging due to their complex aerodynamic behavior and interactions between the mechanical and electrical subsystems. This study presents a robust evaluation of a VAWT control system by integrating aerodynamic and electrical simulations. The proposed approach involves coupling a detailed aerodynamic model with an electrical system simulation to assess the performance and robustness of various control strategies under different operating conditions. The aerodynamic model uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate wind flow and turbine blade interactions, while the electrical simulation incorporates generator dynamics and control algorithms. The study evaluates control system performance through a series of simulations, focusing on efficiency, stability, and response to varying wind speeds and turbine loads. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated simulation approach in identifying optimal control strategies and improving overall turbine performance. This work contributes to advancing the design and implementation of robust control systems for VAWTs, with implications for enhancing their reliability and efficiency in real-world applications.

### Introduction

#### Background

Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) due to their unique advantages. Unlike HAWTs, VAWTs can capture wind from any direction, making them suitable for turbulent or variable wind environments commonly found in urban areas and offshore locations. Additionally, VAWTs typically have a more compact footprint, which is advantageous for installations in constrained spaces.

Despite these advantages, VAWTs face significant challenges in terms of control and optimization. The aerodynamic behavior of VAWTs is inherently more complex due to their rotating blades interacting with the wind from multiple directions. This complexity necessitates sophisticated control systems to ensure optimal performance and stability. Moreover, the interaction between the aerodynamic forces and the electrical systems, including the generator and power electronics, adds another layer of complexity.
