### Abstract

This paper presents a numerical model developed to simulate swash motion and air entrapment phenomena on coarse-grained beaches. The study aims to enhance the understanding of how swash waves interact with coarse sediments and how air entrapment affects the dynamics of these waves. The model incorporates detailed physical processes, including wave breaking, sediment transport, and air pocket formation, to accurately simulate the complex interactions on coarse-grained beach surfaces. Results from the model reveal significant effects of sediment grain size and beach slope on swash behavior and air entrapment dynamics. The findings provide valuable insights into the impact of sediment characteristics on coastal processes and offer implications for coastal engineering, beach nourishment projects, and erosion control strategies.

### Introduction

#### Background

Swash motion—the movement of water up and down the beach face driven by breaking waves—plays a crucial role in coastal processes such as sediment transport, beach morphology, and erosion. On coarse-grained beaches, where sediment particles are larger than typical sand, the dynamics of swash waves can be significantly different due to the interaction between water, sediment, and air. Air entrapment, a phenomenon where air is trapped within the sediment matrix during swash wave interaction, can influence wave dynamics and sediment transport processes.

Understanding the behavior of swash waves on coarse-grained beaches is essential for effective coastal management and engineering. Traditional models often simplify sediment interactions, leading to a less accurate representation of real-world scenarios. Therefore, developing a detailed numerical model that incorporates air entrapment and sediment dynamics is crucial for improving our understanding of swash motion on coarse-grained beaches.

#### Literature Review

Existing research on swash dynamics has predominantly focused on fine-grained sands and simplified sediment interactions. **Hughes and Gerding (2014)** provided a comprehensive review of swash zone dynamics and sediment transport in fine sand beaches. **Schokker et al. (2015)** investigated the impact of sediment characteristics on wave run-up and energy dissipation.

Studies specifically addressing coarse-grained beaches and air entrapment are limited. **Lamb and Dey (2016)** explored the effects of sediment size on swash hydrodynamics in laboratory experiments, while **Van der Wegen et al. (2018)** studied the impact of coarse sediment on beach morphology using numerical models. These studies underscore the need for more detailed models that account for air entrapment and sediment interactions on coarse-grained beaches.
