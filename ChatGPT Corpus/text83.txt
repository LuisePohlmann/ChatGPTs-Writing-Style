### Abstract

The performance of wind farms tends to decline over time due to various factors including wear and tear, technological obsolescence, and changes in operational efficiency. This study investigates how wind farm performance declines with age, focusing on both operational and environmental factors that contribute to this degradation. By analyzing long-term performance data from multiple wind farms and conducting a comprehensive review of maintenance records, this study aims to quantify the rate of performance decline and identify key factors influencing it. Key metrics such as capacity factor, energy production, and turbine efficiency are assessed in relation to the age of the turbines. The analysis also includes an examination of the impact of maintenance strategies, technological upgrades, and environmental conditions on performance degradation. The findings highlight significant trends in performance decline and provide recommendations for improving the longevity and efficiency of wind farms. This research contributes to the optimization of wind farm management practices and supports the development of strategies to mitigate performance loss over time.

### Introduction

#### Background

Wind energy has become a major contributor to the global renewable energy mix, offering a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Wind farms, comprising multiple wind turbines, harness wind energy to generate electricity, and their performance is critical to achieving energy goals and ensuring economic viability. However, as wind turbines age, their performance can decline due to a range of factors including mechanical wear, technological obsolescence, and changing environmental conditions.

Understanding how wind farm performance declines with age is crucial for optimizing maintenance strategies, planning for equipment upgrades, and ensuring continued efficiency and energy production. The decline in performance can lead to reduced energy output, increased operational costs, and lower returns on investment. Therefore, it is important to quantify this decline and identify the underlying factors that contribute to it.
