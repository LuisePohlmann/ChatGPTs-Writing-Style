### Abstract

This study investigates the correlation between Mediterranean shallow water deposits and global Oligocene-Miocene stratigraphy and oceanic events. The Oligocene-Miocene transition (approximately 23 to 5 million years ago) is a crucial period in Earth's history, characterized by significant climatic and oceanographic changes. These include the development of major ocean currents, shifts in global climate patterns, and the onset of Antarctic glaciation. The Mediterranean region, with its unique sedimentary environments, provides valuable records of these global changes through its shallow water deposits. By analyzing sediment cores and outcrops from Mediterranean shallow water environments, and comparing them with global stratigraphic and oceanographic data, this study aims to elucidate the regional manifestations of global events and refine the temporal and spatial resolution of Mediterranean sedimentary records. Our results reveal that Mediterranean shallow water deposits exhibit distinctive patterns corresponding to major oceanic and climatic events, including variations in sediment composition and depositional rates that align with global changes. This correlation enhances our understanding of the Mediterranean's role in the broader context of Oligocene-Miocene oceanographic and climatic evolution and provides a refined framework for interpreting ancient climate and oceanic conditions.

### Introduction

#### Background

The Oligocene-Miocene transition, spanning from approximately 23 to 5 million years ago, represents a dynamic period in Earth's geological history marked by profound climatic, oceanographic, and tectonic changes. This era witnessed significant events such as the intensification of Antarctic glaciation, the establishment of modern oceanic currents, and substantial shifts in global climate patterns. Understanding these changes is crucial for reconstructing past climate conditions and their impact on marine and terrestrial environments.

Mediterranean shallow water deposits, which accumulate in the region's coastal and shelf environments, offer a rich archive of sedimentological and paleoenvironmental information. These deposits are sensitive to regional and global climatic changes and can provide insights into how global events were recorded in different parts of the world. By correlating Mediterranean sedimentary records with global stratigraphy and oceanic events, researchers can gain a better understanding of the regional responses to these global changes and refine the chronological framework of ancient environmental conditions.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Mediterranean Shallow Water Deposits**: Sediments accumulated in coastal and shelf environments of the Mediterranean region, reflecting regional and global environmental changes.
2. **Oligocene-Miocene Transition**: A period characterized by significant climatic and oceanographic changes, including the onset of Antarctic glaciation and shifts in global climate patterns.
3. **Stratigraphic Correlation**: The process of aligning sedimentary records from different regions and time periods to establish a coherent timeline of past environmental changes.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example of applying this study is in the reconstruction of past sea level changes in the Mediterranean region. By correlating Mediterranean sedimentary records with global sea level curves, researchers can better understand how sea levels fluctuated during the Oligocene-Miocene transition and the implications for regional coastal environments.

Another application is in the study of past oceanographic conditions, such as the development of major ocean currents. By linking sedimentary patterns in the Mediterranean with global oceanographic events, researchers can gain insights into how these currents influenced regional sedimentation and climate.

- **Stratigraphic Correlation**: Comparison of Mediterranean sedimentary records with global stratigraphic frameworks, including key marine and terrestrial markers.
- **Oceanographic Event Correlation**: Identification of sedimentary changes corresponding to major oceanographic and climatic events.

The discussion will interpret these results in the context of global and regional environmental changes, exploring the mechanisms through which global events influenced Mediterranean sedimentation. We will compare our findings with existing research and highlight the implications for understanding past climate and oceanographic conditions.

#### Conclusion

This study demonstrates that Mediterranean shallow water deposits provide valuable insights into global Oligocene-Miocene stratigraphy and oceanic events. By correlating sedimentary records with global data, we have refined the temporal and spatial framework of Mediterranean sedimentary history and enhanced our understanding of the region's response to global climatic and oceanographic changes.
