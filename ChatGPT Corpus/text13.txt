### Abstract

This paper investigates the integrality of the Chern character in the context of vector bundles with small codimension. The Chern character, a fundamental tool in algebraic topology and differential geometry, connects topological invariants of vector bundles with cohomological classes. While its integrality properties are well-understood in general settings, there remains a gap in the detailed understanding of these properties when the codimension of the subvariety involved is small. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the integrality conditions for the Chern character in small codimension scenarios. We employ advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and topology to derive new integrality results, and we illustrate these findings with explicit examples. Our results have significant implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in geometry and topology.

### Introduction

#### Background

The Chern character is an essential construct in algebraic topology and differential geometry, serving as a bridge between the topology of vector bundles and their cohomological characteristics. It translates complex geometrical data into cohomology classes, which are easier to handle and apply in various mathematical and physical contexts. Mathematically, the Chern character ch(E) of a vector bundle E over a smooth manifold or an algebraic variety X is a formal sum involving the Chern classes of E, which are topological invariants that describe the curvature and other geometric properties of the bundle.

The integrality of the Chern character is a crucial property, particularly when considering applications in areas such as string theory, where topological invariants play a key role. Generally, the Chern character is expressed in rational cohomology, but under certain conditions, it can take integer values. Understanding these conditions is vital for both theoretical investigations and practical computations in algebraic geometry and related fields.

#### Motivation

While the integrality properties of the Chern character are well-studied in broad contexts, there remains a notable gap in understanding when it comes to cases of small codimension. Codimension, which refers to the difference between the dimension of a space and a subspace, plays a significant role in the behavior of vector bundles and their associated invariants. In particular, small codimension scenarios often arise in complex geometric configurations and singular spaces, where standard results may not directly apply or need refinement.

Exploring the integrality of the Chern character in small codimension is not only of theoretical interest but also of practical significance. It can lead to more precise characterizations of geometric structures and inform the development of computational tools for topological and geometric applications. Moreover, these integrality conditions are pivotal in certain applications in mathematical physics, where discrete quantities are often required.

#### Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of this paper are to:

1. **Investigate Integrality Conditions**: Explore the conditions under which the Chern character exhibits integrality in scenarios involving small codimension.
2. **Develop Theoretical Framework**: Establish a robust theoretical framework using advanced techniques from algebraic geometry and topology to analyze these conditions.
3. **Provide Explicit Examples**: Illustrate the theoretical findings with explicit examples to demonstrate the practical implications and applications of the results.
4. **Implications and Applications**: Discuss the broader implications of our findings for research in geometry, topology, and related fields, and outline potential applications.

The scope of this study encompasses both the theoretical development of integrality conditions for the Chern character and their practical demonstration through examples. We focus particularly on cases where the codimension is small, aiming to provide new insights and results that complement existing knowledge in the field.

#### Methodology

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Develop a theoretical framework to analyze the integrality of the Chern character in small codimension scenarios. This involves leveraging advanced concepts from algebraic geometry, such as sheaf cohomology, and topological techniques.
2. **Cohomological Techniques**: Utilize cohomological methods to explore the conditions under which the Chern character remains integral. This includes studying the interaction between Chern classes and the cohomological properties of the underlying space.
3. **Explicit Computations**: Perform explicit computations to illustrate the theoretical findings. This involves calculating the Chern character for specific examples of vector bundles and subvarieties with small codimension.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the integrality conditions derived in small codimension scenarios with those in more general settings to highlight differences and similarities.

#### Literature Review

The study of the Chern character and its integrality properties has a rich history in both algebraic topology and differential geometry. Classical results provide a comprehensive understanding of the Chern character in general contexts, particularly its role in K-theory and its relationship with other topological invariants.

In algebraic geometry, the Chern character plays a crucial role in the Riemann-Roch theorem and its various generalizations, which relate the geometry of vector bundles to their cohomological properties. Significant progress has been made in understanding the integrality of the Chern character in these settings, with key contributions from mathematicians such as Grothendieck, Atiyah, and Hirzebruch.

However, the specific case of small codimension has received less attention. Some recent studies have begun to address this gap, exploring the behavior of vector bundles and their invariants in more constrained geometric settings. These works suggest that new integrality conditions may emerge in small codimension scenarios, warranting a detailed investigation.

#### Importance of Small Codimension

Small codimension scenarios are particularly interesting because they often involve subvarieties that are close in dimension to the ambient space, leading to unique geometric and topological phenomena. For instance, in codimension one, subvarieties correspond to divisors, which have well-known properties and applications in algebraic geometry. As the codimension increases slightly, the analysis becomes more complex but also more insightful.

Understanding the integrality of the Chern character in these cases can reveal new aspects of the interaction between geometry and topology. It can also inform the development of algorithms for computing topological invariants in practical applications, such as in computational geometry and mathematical physics.

#### Key Theoretical Concepts

1. **Chern Classes**: Fundamental topological invariants associated with vector bundles, which form the building blocks of the Chern character.
2. **Sheaf Cohomology**: A powerful tool in algebraic geometry for studying the properties of sheaves, which are used to define and analyze cohomological invariants.
3. **K-Theory**: A framework in which vector bundles and their invariants are studied, providing a deep connection between algebraic and topological properties.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

To illustrate the theoretical findings, we consider specific examples of vector bundles over subvarieties with small codimension. These examples demonstrate how the integrality conditions manifest in practice and provide concrete cases for further study. Potential applications of these results include:

1. **Algebraic Geometry**: Refining the understanding of vector bundle properties in complex geometric settings.
2. **Mathematical Physics**: Applying integrality conditions to discrete invariants in physical theories, such as string theory.
3. **Computational Geometry**: Enhancing algorithms for computing topological invariants in practical applications, such as material science and data analysis.

#### Results and Discussion

The results section presents the main findings of our theoretical analysis and explicit computations. We derive new integrality conditions for the Chern character in small codimension scenarios and compare these with existing results in more general settings. The discussion interprets these findings in the context of both theoretical and practical applications, highlighting their significance and potential impact.

#### Conclusion

This study advances the understanding of the integrality of the Chern character by focusing on scenarios involving small codimension. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and explicit examples, we provide new insights into the conditions under which the Chern character remains integral. These findings have important implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in geometry, topology, and related fields.

#### Future Work

Future research directions include:

1. **Extended Analysis**: Investigating the integrality of the Chern character in even more specialized scenarios, such as higher codimension or singular spaces.
2. **Experimental Validation**: Conducting experimental studies to validate the theoretical findings and explore their applicability in real-world contexts.
3. **Broader Applications**: Extending the analysis to other invariants and geometric settings, such as symplectic and complex manifolds.

By addressing these areas, future work can build on the results of this study to further enhance the understanding and application of the Chern character in diverse mathematical contexts.
