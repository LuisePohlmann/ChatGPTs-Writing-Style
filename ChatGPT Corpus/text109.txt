### Abstract

**Objective:** The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) stem cells grown on a polyester matrix to form polarized RPE monolayers and their viability and functionality after grafting into the subretinal space of a rabbit model. The ability to maintain the structure and function of these cells post-grafting is critical for their potential use in regenerative therapies for retinal diseases.

**Methods:** Human RPE stem cells were cultured on a polyester matrix to develop polarized monolayers. The cells were characterized for their morphological and functional properties using immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiological assays. Following in vitro evaluation, the polyester matrix with the RPE monolayers was transplanted into the subretinal space of rabbits. Post-grafting, the integration, survival, and functionality of the RPE grafts were assessed using a combination of histological analysis, electroretinography, and retinal imaging.

**Results:** The RPE monolayers grown on the polyester matrix exhibited key characteristics of polarized RPE cells, including tight junction formation and the presence of RPE-specific markers. After transplantation into the rabbit subretinal space, the RPE monolayers maintained their structural integrity and polarity. Histological examination and retinal imaging revealed good integration of the grafts with the host retina, and electroretinography demonstrated functional preservation of the grafts, as indicated by maintained electroretinographic responses.

**Conclusion:** Human RPE stem cells cultured on a polyester matrix can be successfully grafted into the subretinal space and maintain their polarized monolayer structure and function. This approach holds promise for the development of cell-based therapies for retinal degenerative diseases and could potentially improve outcomes for patients suffering from vision loss due to retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction.

### Introduction

#### Background

**Retinal Degenerative Diseases:** Retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), represent significant causes of vision loss and blindness worldwide. These conditions often involve the progressive degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells crucial for maintaining retinal function and health. The RPE supports photoreceptor cells, recycles visual pigments, and maintains the blood-retinal barrier.

**Stem Cell Therapy for Retinal Repair:** Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy to replace damaged RPE cells and restore retinal function. Human RPE stem cells, with their ability to differentiate into functional RPE cells, offer potential for such therapies. However, successful translation into clinical applications requires not only effective differentiation and functional integration but also the ability to maintain cell functionality after transplantation.

**Matrix Support for Cell Culture and Transplantation:** The choice of substrate or matrix for culturing stem cells is critical for maintaining cell functionality and promoting successful integration post-transplantation. Polyester matrices, known for their biocompatibility and ability to support cell growth, are used in various tissue engineering applications. This study explores the use of a polyester matrix for growing RPE stem cells into polarized monolayers and assesses their performance after grafting into the subretinal space.

#### Objective

This study aims to:

1. Evaluate the ability of human RPE stem cells to form polarized monolayers on a polyester matrix.
2. Assess the survival, integration, and functionality of these RPE monolayers after transplantation into the subretinal space of a rabbit model.
3. Provide insights into the potential of polyester matrices as a support for stem cell-based therapies for retinal diseases.

#### Literature Review

**Polarization of RPE Cells:** Polarization is a key feature of functional RPE cells, involving the formation of tight junctions and the establishment of apical-basal polarity. Various studies have demonstrated that RPE cells maintain their polarized state when cultured on appropriate substrates, which is crucial for their function in vivo.

**Use of Polyester Matrices:** Polyester-based matrices have been utilized in tissue engineering due to their favorable mechanical properties and biocompatibility. These matrices can support cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation, making them suitable candidates for stem cell culture and transplantation applications.

**Previous Studies:** Previous research has shown the potential of stem cell-based RPE replacement therapies. For example, studies using RPE cells derived from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells have demonstrated their capacity to integrate into the retina and restore function in animal models. However, challenges remain in optimizing cell culture conditions and ensuring long-term survival and functionality post-transplantation.
