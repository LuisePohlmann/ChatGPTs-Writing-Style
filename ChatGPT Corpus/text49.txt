### Abstract

Credit scoring is a crucial task in the financial industry, involving the classification of loan applicants into risk categories to determine their creditworthiness. Imbalanced datasets, where the number of high-risk (default) cases is much smaller than low-risk (non-default) cases, pose a significant challenge in credit scoring. This study presents an experimental comparison of several classification algorithms designed to handle imbalanced credit scoring datasets. We evaluate the performance of traditional classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, alongside advanced techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), and various ensemble methods. We also explore the impact of resampling techniques, including oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE), on classifier performance. Our experimental setup involves applying these algorithms to a diverse set of imbalanced credit scoring datasets, evaluating their performance based on metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Results reveal significant differences in performance across the algorithms, with ensemble methods and resampling techniques generally providing superior results. This study provides actionable insights for practitioners in the financial sector, highlighting effective strategies for improving the performance of credit scoring models on imbalanced datasets.

### Introduction

#### Background

Credit scoring is an essential process in the financial industry, used to assess the risk associated with lending to individuals and businesses. Traditional credit scoring models use historical data to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. These models help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and manage risk effectively. However, one of the significant challenges in credit scoring is dealing with imbalanced datasets, where the number of non-default (low-risk) cases vastly exceeds the number of default (high-risk) cases.

Imbalanced datasets are common in credit scoring due to the relatively low incidence of defaults compared to the large volume of non-defaults. This imbalance can lead to biased classifier performance, where traditional algorithms may have difficulty accurately identifying the minority class (defaults). As a result, there is a need for advanced classification techniques that can effectively handle such imbalances and improve the predictive performance of credit scoring models.

#### Explicit Examples and Applications

An example application of this study is in the development of credit scoring models for financial institutions. By selecting the most effective classification algorithms and resampling techniques, institutions can improve their ability to identify high-risk borrowers and reduce the occurrence of false negatives (i.e., failing to identify a potential default).

Another application is in regulatory compliance. Accurate credit scoring models can help institutions meet regulatory requirements for risk management and ensure fair lending practices by providing more reliable predictions of borrower risk.
